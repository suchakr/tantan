VERSIFIED SINE TABLES IN JÑĀNARĀJA’S
SIDDHĀNTASUNDARA
TOKE KNUDSEN*
(Received 15 December 2012 ; revised 27 September 2013)
Abstract
The use of sines is an indispensible tool in the computation of planetary position in Indian
astronomy, and Sanskrit astronomical treatises include tables of sines or sine differences for this reason.
The Siddhāntasundara of Jñānarāja, composed around 1500 AD, contains two versified tables, a table of
sines and a table of sine differences. In addition to the tables and explanation of their use, Jñānarāja offers
a rationale of the first table, which is unique in Indian astronomy. The inclusion of the rationale fits well
with Jñānarāja’s statement that his treatise is merely the contents of another treatise, the Brahmasiddhānta,
with demonstrations, vāsanās, added.
Key words: India, Indian mathematics, Indian astronomy, Trigonometry in India, History of
trigonometry, Sine tables, Jñānarāja, Siddhāntasundara.
1. INTRODUCTION
An important but under-studied
astronomical treatise in Sanskrit is the
Siddhāntasundara of Jñānarāja.1 Composed
around 1500 AD, the Siddhāntasundara is a
comprehensive treatise that covers both the theory
behind as well as the practical applications of
spherical astronomy.
The Siddhāntasundara belongs to the
Indian astronomical school known as the saura-
paka, so called because the astronomical
knowledge of the school is believed to have
originally been spoken by Sūrya, the Sun God,
for the saura-paka, see Pingree (1978, pp. 608-
618) and Plofker (2009, pp. 71-72). Jñānarāja’s
treatise was the first comprehensive astronomical
work to be written since the composition of the
Siddhāntaśiromai by Bhāskara II in 1150 AD.
One of its prominent characteristics is an attempt
to reconcile two very different cosmologies in the
Indian tradition, namely the cosmology of the
Indian astronomical tradition and the cosmology
of the purāas, a class of sacred Hindu texts.
Jñānarāja’s aim was to emphasize the importance
and authority of the purāas within the
astronomical tradition. This approach led him to
reinterpretation and rejection of certain features
of the astronomical model, as well as
reinterpretation of passages in the sacred texts,
for a discussion of this topic, see Minkowski
(2004).
Pingree’s Census of the Exact Sciences in
Sanskrit (Pingree 1970-94) lists over 50 extant
manuscripts of the Siddhāntasundara, which
indicates that the text traveled between scholarly
communities and was studied by Indian
astronomers. In fact, the text had a significant
impact on the development of Indian astronomy
in the centuries following Jñānarāja, see
Minkowski (2004) for more details.

2. THE SINE FUNCTION IN THE
SIDDHA–NTASUNDARA
Jñānarāja commences a theoretical
discussion of what we today would call
trigonometry at the point in the Siddhāntasundara
where he proceeds from mean to true planetary
motion. Mean planetary motion is discussed in the
madhyamādhikāra of the grahagaitādhyāya of
the text, while true planetary motion is discussed
in the following section, entitled spaādhikāra,
for the structure of the Siddhāntasundara see
Knudsen (2008, pp. 29-35). All references to
passages in the Siddhāntasundara in this article
refer to the edition and translation found in
Knudsen (2008), though the translations have been
revised.
At the beginning of his discussion of
trigonometry, Jñānarāja notes, as other Indian
astronomers have noted before him, that more
accurate planetary positions are needed in order
to, for example, determine the correct timing of
the performance of rites, undertaking of journeys,
and so on (Siddhāntasundara 2.2.1). The key to
such increased accuracy, which is achieved by
computing the true planetary position from the
mean position, is the sine function, an
indispensible tool needed to work out the
geometrical model of true planetary positions. As
such, Jñānarāja opens his section on true planetary
motion with a discussion of sines. Sines, including
versified tables of values and instructions on how
to use the tables, are covered in Siddhāntasundara
2.2.2-14. All of these 13 verses are cited,
translated, and discussed below.
3. THE SINE FUNCTION IN SANSKRIT TEXTS
In modern mathematics, the trigonometric
functions are defined with respect to the unit circle,
i.e., a circle of radius 1. In ancient and medieval
India, however, the sine function is not defined
with respect to a circle of fixed radius, and
different authors use different values for the radius
of the circle of reference when discussing the sine
function (for a recent work on the history of
trigonometry from ancient times to about 1550
AD, see Van Brummelen (2009), and for a recent
survey of the history of mathematics in India, see
Plofker (2009)). In fact, as we shall see is the case
with Jñānarāja, an author may introduce more than
one value of the radius in the same treatise.
Another example is Bhāskara II, who gives tables
with radii 3438 and 150 in the Siddhāntaśiromai.
Fig.1: Chord and sine.
In modern mathematics, we generally
think of the sine function with respect to an angle.
For example, sin(37°) is read as the sine of an angle
of 37 degrees. In India, however, a sine was
thought of with respect to an arc rather than an
angle. For example, in Fig. 1, we think of the
segment AD as the sine of angle AOD, whereas
the Indian astronomers thought of the segment  as
the sine of the arc . The idea is not all that foreign
to us since we do essentially the same thing when
we work with radians instead of degrees—the
measure of an angle in radians is precisely the
length of the arc of the unit circle spanned by the
angle. We will be using the arc notation below,
following the Indian tradition, though we will
occasionally make reference to angles.
The sine function in India is derived from
the chord function. Since Jñānarāja makesVERSIFIED SINE TABLES IN JÑĀNARĀJA’S SIDDHĀNTASUNDARA
129
reference to chords, as we shall see in the
following, we note here that in Fig. 1, the chord
of the arc ACB is the segment AB. In modern
notation, if α is an angle (or we may think of α as
an arc, following the Indian tradition), then
crd (2α)=2sin(α), where crd denotes the chord
function. Since the sine of a given arc is half the
chord of the double arc, sines are often referred to
in Sanskrit astronomical literature as “half-
chords.”
A common Indian value for the radius is
to have R = 3438. This value is used by Āryabhaa
in the Āryabhaīya, by Bhāskara I in the
Mahābhāskarīya, by Bhāskara II in the
Siddhāntaśiromai, and by other astronomers.
However, a number of other values are also used,
such as R = 3270 by Brahmagupta in the
Brāhmasphumasiddhānta, R = 3415 by Śrīpati in
the Siddhāntaśekhara, R = 60 by Kamalākara in
the Siddhāntatattvaviveka, R = 150 by
Brahmagupta in the Khaakhādyaka, and R = 120
by Bhāskara II in the Siddhāntaśiromai and the
Karaakutūhala. A table of the various values of
the radius used by Indian astronomers can be
found in Gupta (1978) p. 136.
There is a good reason for the choice of
3438 as the radius. There are 21600 minutes of
arc in a circle of 360 degrees, and dividing 2π
into 21600′, we get 
. A
consequence of this is that if α is measured in
minutes of arc and is small, then 3438sin(α)≈α.
In other words, using R = 3438 is similar to using
radians instead of degrees in modern mathematics,
where we have that sin(x) ≈ x when x is measured
in radians and is small. To give an example
with 
R 
= 
3438, 
we 
have 
that
.
It is harder to explain some of the other
choices of radius found in the Indian astronomical
tradition. However, it may be noted that the
choices of R made by the Indian astronomers are
often idiosyncratic, perhaps in order to distinguish
the material in one work from that found in another,
see Gupta (1978) for more details and attempts at
rationales for different values of the radius.
Since R = R sin(90°), the radius R,
whatever it may be in the context in question, is
referred to as the sinus totus, i.e., the “total sine,”
following Gupta (1978).
4. THE SINE FUNCTION IN THE
SIDDHA–NTASUNDARA
The Siddhāntasundara provides its readers
with two versified tables of sines. One is a well-
known and standard table that uses a base circle
with radius R = 3438 and proceeds in steps of 225′
= 3°45′, the other is a table of sine differences
that uses the unusual radius R = 160 and proceeds
in steps of 540′ = 9°. The value R = 160 is not
found elsewhere in Indian astronomy, but as noted
above, the choices of R are often idiosyncratic,
and so there is no particular mathematical
significance to Jñānarāja’s choice of having R =
160. For comparison, in addition to the versified
table utilizing R = 3438 and proceeding in steps
of 225′ = 3°45′ found in the Siddhāntaśiromai,
Bhāskara II gives another versified table using R=
150, which proceeds in steps of 600′ = 10°.
Jñānarāja does not directly specify why he
chose to include two versified tables, nor when to
use which, but the intention seems to be that the
former is the main table of the treatise, while the
latter, the entries of which he calls laghujyās
(“easy sines” or “small sines”), is meant for easy
use.
The only place in the Siddhāntasundara
where we find problems along with sketches of
solutions is in the tripraśnādhikāra (see, for
example, Siddhāntasundara 2.3.17). The sketches
of solutions given there utilize the laghujyās,
which indicates that Jñānarāja felt them
sufficiently accurate for solving problems.
Theoretical discussions, however, generally130
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
assume that the versified table of sines with R =
3438 is used.
We will treat the two tables separately in
the following.
5. THE VERSIFIED TABLE OF SINES
WITH R = 3438
Jñānarāja’s first versified table of Sines is
a sequence of 24 numbers (Siddhāntasundara
2.2.2-5):
two, three thousand four hundred and
nine, three thousand four hundred thirty-
one, and three thousand four hundred
thirty-eight.
The versed sines are equal to the sum of
the differences of these taken in the
opposite order.
In the above verses, Jñānarāja makes use
of the so-called bhūtasakhyā system, in which
Sanskrit words are used to represent numbers (for
the bhūtasakhyā system and other Indian
numerical systems, see (Sarma 2003)). Since the
Siddhāntasundara and other Sanskrit astronomical
treatises are written in verse, it is necessary to
express numbers in words. The bhūtasakhyā
system is one way of doing that.
Some 
manuscripts 
of 
the
Siddhāntasundara add numerals into the verses
for easy reading. However, whether or not
numerals are present in a manuscript depends on
the scribe, and as such they have not been included
in the above, nor in the other verses cited from
the Siddhāntasundara.
Note that all that Jñānarāja provides is a
sequence of numbers. Other than the statement
that the numbers are sines, there is no
accompanying explanation of what each number
represents or how to use the sequence. A greater
context is therefore needed in order to interpret
the numbers.
The interpretation of the sequence of
numbers is as follows. The versified table proceeds
in steps of 225′, i.e., 3°45′, which means that the
first number is the sine of 225′=3°45′, the second
the sine of 450′=7°30′, the third the sine of
675′=11°15′, and so on, up to the 24th number,
which is the sine of 5400′=90°, i.e., the sinus totus,
the radius R = 3438. In other words, the table gives
that R sin (3°45′) = 225, R sin (7°30′) = 449, and
so on.
It is important to note here that it was most
likely Jñānarāja’s intention that angular values
The half chords, i.e., the sines, are, in
order: two hundred twenty-five, four
hundred forty-nine, six hundred seventy-
one, eight hundred ninety, eleven hundred
and five, thirteen hundred and fifteen,
fifteen hundred and twenty, seventeen
hundred and nineteen, nineteen hundred
and ten, two thousand ninety-three, two
thousand two hundred sixty-seven, two
thousand four hundred thirty-one, two
thousand five hundred eighty-five, two
thousand seven hundred twenty-eight,
two thousand eight hundred fifty-nine,
two thousand nine hundred seventy-eight,
three thousand eighty-four, three
thousand one hundred seventy-seven,
three thousand two hundred fifty-six,
three thousand three hundred twenty-one,
three thousand three hundred seventy-VERSIFIED SINE TABLES IN JÑĀNARĀJA’S SIDDHĀNTASUNDARA
131
should be given in minutes of arc when using the
sine table, not degrees (this is not true, however,
for the versified sine table using R = 160 to be
discussed below). However, since we are
accustomed to using degrees rather than minutes
of arc in modern mathematics, we will make use
of both minutes of arc and degrees in the
following.
II gives the same sequence (though the verses
giving them are different from the ones of
Jñānarāja) in the Siddhāntaśiromai.
To study the sequence of sines we will in
the following let αn = n ⋅ 225′ = n ⋅ 3°45′ for n = 0,
1, 2, ..., 24. For example, α0 = 0 = 0°, α1 = 225′ =
3°45′, and α2 = 450′ = 7°30′. As such, the nth entry
of the table is R sin (αn) for n = 1, 2, ..., 24. Sine
differences will play a role in the following as well,
so we let ∆n denote the nth sine difference, i.e.,
∆n= R sin (αn) – R sin (αn-1) for n = 1, 2, ..., 24. To
give an example of a sine difference, we have that
∆7= R sin (α7) – R sin (α6) = 1520 – 1315 = 205.
Note that the Siddhāntasundara does not
provide a ready sequence of sine differences for
R = 3438, so the reader has to compute them
themselves from the values given in the versified
table.
6. VERSED SINES
After giving the sines of 3°45′, 7°30′, and
so on, Jñānarāja proceeds to note that these can
also be used to determine the versed sines of the
same arcs. Before proceeding to a discussion of
versed sines, it is important to note that there is
no tabulation of versed sines in the
Siddhāntasundara. In other words, the
functionality of the versified table of sines goes
beyond merely listing sine values—by
manipulating the tabulated numbers, we can find
the values of other functions, in this case the versed
sine function.
The versed sine is a trigonometric function
that is no longer in use, but which was utilized by
the Indian astronomers in ancient and medieval
times. The modern definition of the versed sine
of an angle α is vers(α) = 1-cos(α). Since R =
3438 in Jñānarāja’s system, what can be found
from the versified table of sines is R vers (αn) = R
– R cos (αn) for n = 1,2,..., 24, here expressed in
modern notation.

Table 1 lists the sine number, the
corresponding arc in degrees, the corresponding
sine (the only data given in the Siddhāntasundara),
and the modern value to two decimal places for
comparison.
It is important to note here that the
sequence given in the versified table is by no
means unique to Jñānarāja. For example, Bhāskara132
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
Note that Jñānarāja does not directly speak
of the cosine function, and to the Indian
astronomers the versed sine is a segment having a
certain measure. More specifically, in Fig.1, the
versed sine of the arc AC is the segment CD.
Jñānarāja tells us that the versed sines can
be found by adding up sine differences “in the
opposite order,” i.e., via the formula
for n = 1,2,K,24. The formula is fairly
straightforward and can be proved as follows:
The versified table naturally allows us to
find the sines of the arcs α1, α2, ..., α24, but it can
also be used to approximate the sine of any arc α,
with 0 ≤ α ≤ 90°, including those not given in the
table. We will see below how the table can be used
for that purpose.
7. JN~A– NARA– JA’S RATIONALE
Jñānarāja does not merely provide the
versified table of sines, but offers a rationale for it
as well (Siddhāntasundara 2.2.6-9):
On a circle, consisting of the minutes of
arc in a circle and marked with the ninety-
sixth parts of the circumference, the
chords are to be drawn lying on both of
the two points [among the ninety six
points marked] that are on a line running
east-west.
Accordingly, they are forty-eight.
Furthermore, their [corresponding] arcs
are to be considered; a versed sine is lying
between the arc and [its corresponding]
chord.
The first sine is equal to the ninety-sixth
part of the minutes of arc in a circle [i.e.,
two hundred twenty-five]. [It is] the leg
[in a right-angled triangle], and the
[corresponding] hypotenuse is the radius.
If the upright is found from these two
when the hypotenuse [in this way] is the
radius, what is [the upright] when [the
hypotenuse] is equal to two hundred
twenty-five? The result thus [obtained] is
an approximate [value of] the difference
between the first sine and the following
one.
[When] the upright is multiplied by ten
and divided by one hundred fifty-three,
the [sine] difference is produced. [In other
words,] the second [sine] is produced
from the first sine increased by that
[quantity], and so on like that.
Half of the sum of the traversed [sine]
difference and the current [sine]
difference is the correct sine difference.
In this way, all the sines are produced in
order.
We consider the person who computes all
half-chords in due order from the first
half-chord to be the polestar in theVERSIFIED SINE TABLES IN JÑĀNARĀJA’S SIDDHĀNTASUNDARA
133
fastening of the motion of the circle of
those who know computation and the
circle of stars.
For the construction of the chords,
Jñānarāja considers the circumference of a circle
evenly marked with 96 points, as shown on Fig.
2. On the figure, the bold vertical line is the north-
south line. Points lying symmetrically about this
line are then joined by line segments, running east-
west, as shown in the figure (note that to be seen
from Jñānarāja’s point of view, the figure should
be turned  degrees). The bold horizontal line is
the east-west line. If the two points on the north-
south line are counted together one time as a line
segment (the reason for this will be clear in the
following), the construction gives a total of forty-
eight line segments. Note that two consecutive
points on the circumference of the circle are
separated by 
, which is
precisely the step in Jñānarāja’s versified sine
table.
All in all, we see from Fig. 2 that the
construction of the 48 line segments gives us forty-
eight chords. Note that the two points on the north-
south line correspond to the chord of  0° and the
chord of 360°, both of which are equal to 0.
If we connect the center of the circle, O,
to the point just above the east-west line and to
the right of the north-south line, A, and then drop
a perpendicular from A to the east-west line,
touching it at B, we create a right triangle OAB.
The triangle is shown on Fig. 2, though note that
the perpendicular is indistinguishable from part
of the arc of the circle on the figure.
If the circle has radius R = 3438, it follows
that the arc corresponding to the segment AB is
approximately 225 in length, since the angle AOB
is 225′ and R sin (α) ≈ α when α is measured in
minutes of arc and is small. As can be readily
verified, the length of the perpendicular AB is also
approximately 225, i.e., approximately Rsin (225′)
= Rsin (α1), in agreement with what Jñānarāja tells
us.
The preceding is a standard geometrical
derivation of the sines in the Indian tradition, and
so it is not unique to Jñānarāja, nor is it of major
interest to us. It is in the next step in Jñānarāja’s
rationale that the material becomes interesting.
As noted by Jñānarāja and seen in Fig. 2,
R sin (α1) is the leg in a right triangle with
hypotenuse R. Jñānarāja next considers a similar
but smaller right triangle, though its details are
somewhat surprising and its derivation unclear.
The meaning of the Sanskrit text is to find a
proportion from the similarity of two right
triangles: If the upright is found from the leg (i.e.,
225) and the hypotenuse (i.e., R = 3438) of the
original right triangle, what is the leg in the smaller
triangle? To answer this, we must know the
hypotenuse of the small triangle. The compound
word trijyākare in the Sanskrit text is somewhat
unclear, though the meaning seems to be simply
“hypotenuse,” as it is taken in the above
translation. Separating the compound into the two
words trijyā (which would mean the radius, i.e.,
R = 3438) and kare would present the problem
of what role the word trijyā plays in the sentence.
At the same time, if we assume that it is a side in
Fig. 2: Construction of forty-eight chords.134
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
the small triangle other than the hypotenuse, which
is of length 225, the proportion does not yield
anything useful.
In other words, the most likely
interpretation of the passage is that the hypotenuse
in the small triangle is assumed to be 225, i.e.,
Rsin(α1). How to visualize the new triangle is not
clear, however, and Jñānarāja does not provide any
diagrams or instructions on making diagrams to
go with his construction. The idea is probably as
outlined in the following.
Consider Fig. 3. Assume that the radius of
the circle is R = 3438 and that the arc FB
corresponds to 3°45′ (note that the figure does not
present true proportions since the angle AOB in
the figure is not 3°45′). Assume also that the arc
FC is 7°30′. In other words, the triangle OAB is
the large triangle referred to before with
hypotenuse OB =R = 3438 and leg AB = Rsin(α1)
= 225. If we draw the line AE from A
perpendicularly onto the segment OB, meeting it
at , triangle AEB is the small triangle. It is similar
to triangle OAB and its hypotenuse is AB = 225.
The upright in the large triangle is OA in
Figure 3. From the similarity of the two triangles,
we get 
. In other words, we have that
.
Jñānarāja does not consider cosines
directly, but if we use modern notation, we get
that 
, and therefore
.
Now, Jñānarāja says that the upright in the
smaller triangle, AE, is approximately equal to the
second sine difference, 
. In
other 
words, 
we 
have 
that
. 
On
Figure 3, ∆2 is the segment DC, so that AE ≈ DC.
It is not really clear, however, that AE is
approximately equal to DC. The following
derivation, where we will use the trigonometric
relation 
 for
all α and β, show the relationship between the
two quantities:
Fig. 3: Two similar triangles.
The first approximation follows from the
observation that 
 if α is measured in
minutes of arc and is small.
The weak link in the derivation is the
second approximation. We do not know, of course,
that the approximation 
was actually used by Jñānarāja. It was certainly
not used in the form given by us, since the
Siddhāntasundara does not make direct referenceVERSIFIED SINE TABLES IN JÑĀNARĀJA’S SIDDHĀNTASUNDARA
135
to cosines. However, even though Jñānarāja’s
rationale is unknown to us, using this
approximation in the above give us an idea about
a derivation, as well as a way to measure its
inaccuracy. If we do a direct calculation, we get
that 
Rcos(225) 
= 
3430.638 
whereas
, so to consider that
 and 
 are approximately
equal introduces an error. Just as it is not clear
what method Jñānarāja utilized to arrive at his
formula, he does not address any issues of error
other than telling us that the formula is
approximate, thereby acknowledging that there is
an error. The error introduced is about 0.27%.
Next, Jñānarāja notes that the (n+1)st sine
difference 
can 
be 
found 
as
.
From this we get the following relation:
Similarly to before, it is the approximation
 that is the weak point of
the derivation. Again as before, it is not clear what
method Jñānarāja used to deduce the formula.
Similarly, there is no discussion of error other than
the statement that the formula is approximate.
Before addressing the errors of the
Jñānarāja’s formula, we address the final part of
his rationale (not including the eulogy of those
who follow his approach). Jñānarāja’s statement
that half of the sum of the traversed sine difference
and the current sine difference is the corrected sine
difference probably means the following. If an arc
α satisfies αn < α < αn+1, then the traversed sine
difference is ∆n and the current sine difference is
∆n+1. Consider the following derivation:
Jñānarāja tells us that this can be used to
find each R sin (αn) for n = 1,2,...,24.
In the formula, the fraction 
 is simply
an 
approximation 
to 
, 
since
.
We can derive the formula for 
by the same procedure as we just followed in the
case n = 1. In this case, the derivation becomes:
From it we get the result stated in the verse.
It is not clear, however, why this yields a
“corrected” sine difference, nor is it really clear136
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
why we are interested in 
 in the first
place. Jñānarāja provides no further comments on
this.
8. COMPARISON WITH “PROGRESSIVE
CALCULATION”
Jñānarāja’s method for computing the sine
values of the table differ from the method of
“progressive calculation” that Yano (1977, p. 86)
notes is employed, either directly or indirectly, by
Sanskrit astronomical texts using the sine table R
= 3438 with  and steps of 3°45′; though Jñānarāja’s
main table is a table of sines and not sine
differences, worth mentioning is also Hayashi
(1997), which investigates Āryabhaa’s rule and
table for sine differences. According to the
“progressive calculation” method, the (n+1)th sine
can be found by the formula
.
Even though Yano notes that having
 as the last term on the right-hand side
instead of 
 would be more accurate, the
formula is still much more accurate than the one
given by Jñānarāja.
Table 2 gives the sine values as per the
table in the Siddhāntasundara along with the same
values found via Jñānarāja’s formula and via the
method of “progressive calculation” referred to
by Yano. In order to find, say, the 7th sine via
Jñānarāja’s formula, the value of the 6th sine from
Jñānarāja’s table of sines was used, and similarly
for the remaining sine values. For the “progressive
calculation,” the two previous sine values are
taken from the table. It is clearly seen that the
values found using Jñānarāja’s formula are more
inaccurate than those found using “progressive
calculation.” In fact, given the numbers it appears
unlikely that Jñānarāja used his own method to
generate the sine values. The values are, of course,
standard.
9. ARCS BETWEEN 90 AND 360 DEGREES
Jñānarāja’s versified sine table covers only
arcs between 0° and 90°. However, the sines of
arcs between 90° and 360° can also be found via
the versified table. How to do so is explained in
Siddhāntasundara 2.2.10:

There are four quadrants in a circle
divided into [twelve] signs [of thirty
degrees each]. In the first quadrant,
[which spans the first three signs]VERSIFIED SINE TABLES IN JÑĀNARĀJA’S SIDDHĀNTASUNDARA
137
beginning with Aries, there is an increase
in the sine [when the arc increases]. In
the second [quadrant], there is a decrease;
in the third, there is an increase; and in
the fourth, there is a decrease in the leg
[i.e., in the sine].
In Indian astronomy, in addition to being
divided into 360 degrees, a circle is furthermore
divided into twelve signs of 30 degrees each.
These are the twelve zodiacal signs, of which the
sign Aries commences at the 0° point of the circle.
The quadrants are the same as in modern
mathematics.
In modern mathematics, sin(α) is negative
if the angle α is in the third or fourth quadrants,
and positive if it is in the first or second quadrants.
In the Indian tradition, however, Rsin(α) is always
nonnegative. In the verse, Jñānarāja tells us that
sin(α) increases from 0 to 3438 when α increases
from 0° to 90°; that it decreases from 3438 to 0
when α increases from 90° to 180°; that it
increases from 0 to 3438 when α increases from
180° to 270°; and that it decreases from 3438 to 0
when α increases from 270° to 360°. More
specifically,
As such, if we know sin(α) for all α with
0° ≤ α ≤ 90°, we can find sin(α) for all α with 0°
≤ α ≤ 360°. In the following, however, we will
only consider the situation 0° ≤ α ≤ 90°.
10. USING THE VERSIFIED SINE TABLE
The table as given lists only the sines of
α1,α2,...,α24, but not the sines of other arcs. In order
to compute the sine of an arc α with 0° ≤ α ≤ 90°
and α ≠ αi for i = 1,2,...,24 Jñānarāja gives the
following instructions (Siddhāntasundara 2.2.11):
The complement [of a given arc] is ninety
[degrees] diminished by the degrees of
the arc. The minutes of arc of those two
[quantities] are [separately] divided by
two hundred twenty-five. The sine whose
number corresponds to [the quotient of]
each result is increased by what is attained
as a result of the division of the divisor
[of the previous division, i.e., two hundred
twenty-five] into the remainder [of the
previous division] multiplied by the
difference between the traversed and
current sines.
Let α be measured in minutes of arc and
satisfy that α0 = 0′ ≤ α ≤ 5400′ = 90° = α24. Note
that Jñānarāja instructs the reader to
simultaneously find both Rsin(α) and Rsin(90°–
α), though in the following we will demonstrate
only how to find the former; finding the latter is
done by the same procedure by replacing α by its
complement 90°–α.
Let q and r be, respectively, the quotient
and remainder of the division of α by 225. Then
α = 225q + r where 0 ≤ r ≤ 225. Furthermore, we
have that R sin (αq) ≤ R sin (α) < R sin (αq+1).
Jñānarāja refers to Rsin(αq) as the traversed
sine and to Rsin(αq+1) as the current sine. We
can 
now 
compute 
Rsin(α) 
as
. 
As
already noted, this is common linear interpolation.
To give an example, if we want to compute
R sin (1440′), we note that 1440 = 6⋅225 + 90.
Therefore,
For comparison, the modern value of
R sin (1440′) is 1398.360.
Linear interpolation can also be used to
find α when R sin (α) is known (Siddhāntasundara
2.2.12):138
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
[Start by] subtracting the [greatest
possible] sine [given in the versified table
from the given sine]. Whatever is the
result of the remainder [of the subtraction
of the two sines] divided by the difference
between the traversed and current sines,
the arc [corresponding to the given sine]
is [equal to] that increased by two hundred
twenty-five multiplied by the number
[corresponding to] how large the
subtracted sine was.
Suppose that we are given the value of a
sine, for example Rsin(α), and want to find α,
which we assume to be between 0° and 90°. First
we find the greatest positive integer m that satisfies
R sin (αm) ≤ R sin (α) < R sin (αm+1). As in the
previous, R sin (αm) is called the traversed sine
and R sin (αm+1) the current sine. We subtract
R sin (αm) from R sin (α). The number
corresponding to the sine that we subtracted, i.e.,
Rsin(αm), is m. According to Jñānarāja, α,
measured in minutes of arc, can be found as
. This, again, is
common linear interpolation.
To give an example, suppose that Rsin(α)
= 1631. Then we have Rsin(α7) < Rsin(α) <
Rsin(α8), so that m=7. From the formula, we get
that
.
A modern calculation gives us that
R sin (1700.502′) = 1632.117.
11. THE SINE TABLE WITH R = 160
As was already noted, for the second
versified table, which gives differences of sines
rather than sines, Jñānarāja uses R = 160 as the
radius of the base circle and proceeds in steps
of 9°. The table, like the previous table, is
given as a sequence of numbers, 10 in total,
in the Siddhāntasundara (2.2.13, first three
quarters):
The [successive] differences of the easy
sines are twenty-five, twenty-four,
twenty-three, twenty-one, nineteen,
sixteen, thirteen, ten, six, and three.
Similarly to before, we will define βn =
n⋅9° and ∆n = R sin (βn) – R sin (βn–1) for
n=1,2,....,10. The interpretation of the sequence
of numbers is that each number is not directly a
sine, but a sine difference. For example, the fourth
number, 21, is the difference ∆4 = Rsin(β4) –
Rsin(β3). We can therefore reconstruct the actual
sine values as 
. Jñānarāja calls the
tabulated sine differences laghujyā (“easy sines”
or “small sines”).
Table 3 lists the sine number, the
corresponding arc, the sine difference ∆n (the only
data given in the Siddhāntasundara), the
corresponding sine, the modern value of the sine,
and the modern value of the sine difference (the
latter two for comparison).
There is no doubt that Jñānarāja’s reason
for including the second sine table is that it is easier
to do computations with the sine differences given
therein; the numbers are smaller and there are
fewer of them. However, the increase in ease of
use comes at a cost, namely that of less accuracy,
due to the step between sine differences being
larger than the step between sines in the previous
table.VERSIFIED SINE TABLES IN JÑĀNARĀJA’S SIDDHĀNTASUNDARA
139
As with the previous sine table, the present
table 3 can be used to compute the sine of a given
arc β, as well as the arc corresponding to a given
sine R sin(β) (Siddhāntasundara 2.2.13 (last
quarter) and 2.2.14 (first two quarters)):
The degrees of the arc are divided by nine.
[The quotient of the division] is [the
number of] the traversed sine. The
remainder [of the division] is multiplied
by the current sine and divided by nine.
[The result is then] increased by the
traversed [sine] differences.
Note that the procedure given here by
Jñānarāja relies on β being measured in degrees,
not in minutes of arc as was the case with the
versified table using R = 3438.
Let β be an arc and let q and r be the
quotient and the remainder, respectively, of the
division of β by 9. Then β = 9q + r, where 0 ≤ r <
9. The sine of β can now be found as
. This is, again, linear
interpolation.
As an example, if β = 71°, then 71 = 9⋅7 +
8, and therefore
The modern value of R sin(71°) = 160
sin(71°) is 151.283.
If instead of an arc we are given the value
of a sine, say R sin(β), Jñānarāja gives us a rule
for finding β as follows (Siddhāntasundara 2.2.14
(last two quarters)):
One should subtract [as many of] the
[sine] differences [from the given sin as
possible]. [When] the result from the
division of the remainder [of the
subtraction process] by the current [sine
difference] is increased by nine multiplied
by the number corresponding to the
traversed [sine difference], [the result] is
the arc.
Let n be the largest possible integer
that
 satisfies that  is nonnegative.
Put in another way, we subtract as many successive
sine differences as possible from R sin (β), yielding
the result r. Then β can be found as 
.

To give an example, if Rsin(β) = 77, we
can subtract three sine differences, so that n = 3
and r = 77 – (25 + 24 + 23) = 5. We then find β,
measured in degrees, as
The modern value is

This is, once again, linear interpolation.
12. CONCLUSION
On the whole, Jñānarāja’s treatment of sine
tables and sines in the Siddhāntasundara remains
broadly within what one would expect to find in a
Sanskrit astronomical treatise. For example, the
main versified sine table, which uses the radius
R = 3438, is identical to the one given by previous
astronomers, such as Bhāskara II. While the radius
R = 160 of Jñānarāja’s versified table of “easy
sines” is not found elsewhere in Indian astronomy,
which is true also for the step of 9° used for it, the
creation of such “easy” tables is idiosyncratic and
as such it does not stand out. Also the fact that
Jñānarāja gives two tables in his section on sines
remains within the tradition. For example, as was
noted above, in addition to the main table with
radius R = 3438, Brahmagupta uses the radius
R = 150 with steps of 15°. Finally it may be noted
that Jñānarāja’s presentation of one table of sines
and another of sine differences is also within the
tradition, as both are found among the writings of
his predecessors in the Indian astronomical
tradition. In other words, only with respect to the
radius and step of the table of “easy sines” does
Jñānarāja show originality.
The point where Jñānarāja’s material does
stand out, however, is in his rationale for
generating the sine values of the versified table
with R = 3438. Rather than merely presenting a
versified table of sines, Jñānarāja decided to
include a procedure for computing the sines one
by one, starting with the first sine, R sin (3°45′) =
225.
That Jñānarāja includes such a procedure
is itself not surprising. In fact, it is consistent with
a statement (Siddhāntasundara 1.1.3) of his that
the Siddhantāsundara presents the astronomical
knowledge of the Brahmasiddhānta to which is
added vāsanās, i.e., demonstrations. (loosely,
proofs, though we need to be aware that the Indian
mathematical tradition did not operate with proofs
in the Euclidean sense). The Brahmasiddhānta is
a somewhat obscure astronomical treatise, dated
by Pingree (1981, p. 26) to the 350-year period
between the composition of the Siddhāntaśiromai
by Bhāskara II in 1150 CE and the composition
of the Siddhantāsundara by Jñānarāja (for a
critical edition of the Brahmasiddhānta with an
introduction in English, see Dhavale (1996).
According to the tradition it presents a lecture
given by the god Brahmā to the sage Nārada and
recorded by the sage Śākalya. Jñānarāja’s attempts
to supply the Brahmasiddhānta with vāsanās is
part of his agenda to emphasize the importance
and authority of the purāas; vāsanās belong to
the prestigious tradition of Bhāskara II, and an
addition of them to the Brahmasiddhānta would
increase the text’s importance making a stronger
case for respecting the authority of the purāGas
in Indian astronomical tradition (for a discussion
of vāsanās and the Brahmasiddhānta, see
Knudsen (2008, pp. 4-6, 35-41).
In modern terms, Jñānarāja’s procedure
amounts to
It differs from other procedures, such as
the “progressive calculation” noted by Yano and
discussed above, and is unique in the Indian
tradition. Jñānarāja’s method, however, is not all
that accurate and Table 2 shows that it produces
numbers that are somewhat off the mark, and
probably unacceptably so.VERSIFIED SINE TABLES IN JÑĀNARĀJA’S SIDDHĀNTASUNDARA
141
The brief nature of the verses in the
Siddhāntasundara (in fact, of verses in Sanskrit
astronomical literature in general) complicates the
reading and understanding of the procedure. The
geometrical constructions alluded to by Jñānarāja,
but not explained clearly in words or via diagrams,
are hard to visualize. In other words, it is not fully
clear how Jñānarāja arrived at the procedure, nor
is it clear why he departs from previous
procedures. Perhaps the procedure was done
hastily by Jñānarāja in order to procedure a vāsanā
for his main sine table. At any rate, the appearance
of a procedure in the discussion of sines fits
perfectly with Jñānarāja’s stated aim of presenting
a text that presents the astronomical system of the
Brahmasiddhānta supplemented with vāsanās.

ARYABHATA : HIS NAME, TIME AND PROVENANCE

K. V. Sarma”

(Received 20 September 2001; after revision 20 October 2001)

Aryabhata is one of the eminent astronomers of early India.
Of late there is a tendency to spell his name as “Aryabhatta”. While
Aryabhata himself mentions Kali 3600 to be the date of his
composing the work, some say that Kali 3600 is the date of his
birth. A view has been broached that Aryabhata hailed from Kerala.
These points have been discussed and an effort has been made in
this paper to arrive at the correct position in these matters.

Keywords: Aryabhata, ASmaka, Kusumapura, Pataliputra

Aryabhata is acknowledged as one of the astute astronomers of early
India. His school of astronomy is well known and widespread all over
India, especially in the South. However, differing voices are heard about
his name, date and provenance. An attempt is made herein below to exam-
ine these matters and set things right.

I. THE NAME OF THE ASTRONOMER : Is ARYABHATTA OR ARYABHATA?

Of late, there has been a tendency to spell the name as “Aryabhatta”
with the suffix “bhatta”. Two artificial satellites sent up into space by In-
dian scientists are given the names “Aryabhatta I” and “Aryabhatta II”. Some
modern writers also make use of this spelling. But, is the spelling of the
astronomer’s name with the suffix “bhatta” correct?

Now, it is to be noted that no astronomical text spells the name as

“Aryabhatta”. The author himself mentions his name at three places only
as “Aryabhata”, towards the beginning and ending verses of his work
Aryabhatiya.'
pranipatyaikam anekam kam satyam devatam param brahma /
Aryabhatas trini gadati ganitam kalakriyam golam //
(Aryabhatiya, Gitikapada, verse 1)

Aryabhatiyam namna
pitrvam svdyambhuvam sada satyam /
sukrtayusoh prandsam
kurute pratikaficukam yo ‘sya //
(Golapada, verse 50)

Our author’s younger contemporary, Varahamihira, too, mentions the
name only as Aryabhata and that too in a verse which forecloses the form
“Aryabhatta”. Thus, while speaking of the two ways of reckoning the day,
viz., from midnight and from sunrise, propounded by our author,
Varahamihira says in his Paricasiddhantika (XV. 20):

lankardharatrasamaye
dinapravrttim jagada caryabhatah /
bhuyah sa eva stiryo-

dayat prabhyty aha lankayam //

In his commentary on Aryabhatiya, Bhaskara I, an ardent follower of
our author, mentions the author’s name only as Aryabhata whenever the
latter is mentioned during the course of the commentary. The concluding
verse of the commentary too mentions the name only as Aryabhata?:

ARYABHATA : HIS NAME, TIME AND PROVENANCE 107

atindriyarthapratipadakani
siitrany amitny Aryabhatoditani /
tesam asakyo ’rthasatamasako ‘pi
vaktum kuto ‘smatsadrsair asesam //
Brahmagupta (6th cent. AD), contemporary of Bhaskara I, mentions
Aryabhata at the beginning verse of his Khandakhadyaka (1.11):
pranipatya mahadevam
jagadutpattisthitipralayahetum /
vaksyami khandakhadyakam
acaryaryabhatatulyaphalam //
Somesvara, another early commentator (c. 1000 AD) on the Aryabhafiya,
too, spells the name of our author only as Aryabhata in the concluding
verse of his commentary:

spastarthapratibodhakam mrdudhiyam siktam prabodhapradam
tarkavyakaranadisuddhamatina Somesvarenadhuna /
AcGryaryabhatokta sutravivrtir ya Bhaskarotpadita
tasyah sdrataram vikrsya racitam bhasyam prakrstam laghu //
In the same vein Stirryadeva Yajvan (c. 1000 AD), hailing from
Tamilnadu, closes his commentary on Aryabhatiya with the verse
triskandharthavida samyak Siiryadevena Yajvana /
sanksipyaryabhataproktasutrartho ‘tra prakasyate //
(Com. on Golapdda, verse 50)
Sankaranarayana, the court-astronomer of the Kerala king Ravivarma
of the 8th century, commences his commentary of the Laghubhaskariya of
Bhaskara I with the verse:
Acaryaryabhatam Varahamihiram
Stimadgurum Bhaskaram /
Govindam Hardattam atra Sirasa
vaksye pranamya kramat //
Gargya-Kerala-Nilakantha Somayaji commences his commentary on the

108 INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE

Aryabhatiya with the verse:
bhagavantam caryabhatam
natva vyakhyayate ‘tha tattantram /
The Kerala commentator Ghatigopa’s commentary commences with
the verse:
gajananam ca vanim ca Sri-suryadin grahan api /
purvacaryams caryabhatapramukhan pranato ’smy aham //
It is to be noted that in all the above cases the name of our author is
spelt only as “Aryabhata’” and not “Aryabhatta” and that the latter form will
revolt against the metre.

It should be obvious from the above that the correct name of our
author is only “Aryabhata” and that the modern tendency to revise the
name to “Aryabhatta” is not warranted.

IL. DATE OF ARYABHATA

Propitiously enough, Aryabhata himself gives a clue to his date in his
Aryabhatiya, Kalakriyépada, verse 10, which reads :

sastyabdandm sastir yada
vyatitas trayas ca yugapadah /
tryadhika vimSatir abdas
tadeha mama janmano 'titah //

“When sixty times sixty years and three quarter yugas (of the current
yuga) had elapsed, twenty three years had then passed since my birth.”

The stanza states that at the time of composing the work 60 X 60 =
3600 years of the Kaliyuga had elapsed and, incidentally, the author adds
that is was then 23 years after his birth. The date works out to the end of
the Kali year 3600, corresponding to the Saka year 421, the date being
March 21, 499. The position of the equinoxes were then zero degree and
so the mean positions of the planets would be accurate if computed using
their parameters given by the author in the Gitikapada of the Aryabhatiya.*

ARYABHATA : HIS NAME, TIME AND PROVENANCE 109

For computation of the mean planetary positions for future dates, a small
correction was to be applied, which Aryabhata’s follower Lallacarya gives in
his work Sisyadhivrddhida.*

While most commentators follow the above interpretation, in Kerala,
the Parahita system enunciated by Haridatta in 689 AD interprets the verse
to mean that the date given in the verse is the date of birth of Aryabhata
and not the date of the composition of the work. “When sixty times sixty
years and three yugas had elapsed, twentythree years of my age have passed
since then.”

This would mean that Aryabhata was born in Kali 3600, equivalent to
Saka 421 or AD 499, and that he composed the Aryabhatiya when he was 25
years old, ie. in Saka 444 or AD 522. But the parameters of Aryabhatiya
accord only with the year Kali 3600. For this reason, in the Parahita system
corrections for computing the mean longitudes of planets using Aryabhata’s

parameters but with the epoch of Saka 444 have been evolved for use in

astronomical computations.®

Il. ASMAKA : ARYABHATA’S PROVENANCE

Aryabhata does not make any specific mention of the place or country
of his birth but this omission is filled by Bhaskara I, his follower and com-
mentator, who is, perhaps, the best authority in the matter on account of
his chronological proximity, besides being the propagator of the Aryabhatiya
school.

Bhiaskara I who hailed from southern Gujarat, as evidenced from ref-
‘erences in his commentary on the Aryabhatiya, calls-himself as Asmakiya,
“one beloging to the Asmaka country”. He also specifies that Aryabhata
too was an Asmakiya, for which reason his work was called Asmakatantra.

110 INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE

Nilakantha Somayaji states specifically in his commentary on Aryabhatiya
(Ganitapada, verse 1): A’makajanapadajata Aryabhatacaryah, “Aryabhata born
in the Asmaka country.”

The ASmaka country was situated, according to Varahamihira
(Brhatasamhita, XIV. 22), the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, in the North-
West of India. According to the Buddhist text Dighanikaya (XIX. 36), dur-
ing the time of the Buddha a branch of the Asmaka people moved to the
South and settled in the modern South Gujarat-North Maharashtra region,
on the banks of the rivers Godavari and Narmada. Several] texts, both
Buddhist and Hindu, attest to this fact. Obviously, Aryabhata hailed from
this region and naturally came to be known as Aémakiya.®

Of late, a quaint suggestion has been made to the effect that Kerala
could have been the country of birth of Aryabhata for two reasons. The
first one is that the word Asmaka, which, in Sanskrit, means “stone”, could
be related to Kotunnallar in Central Kerala, which, during early times, was
one of the capital cities of the land and a centre of learning. It is stated
that its present name could be a derivative of the word Kotum-Kal-l-ir,
meaning “a city of hard stones”, since in Malayalam kotu means hard and
kal means stone. This is linguistically possible, but the incompatibility arises
from the fact that old records show that, during ancient times, the city was
known as Kotum-kol-iir, “the city of strict governance”. Naturally enough,
the harsher pronouncing word Kotum-kol-ir slipped into the more easily
pronounced word Kotunnallur. That the said ancient name of the city occurs
in certain early texts has been noticed by the veteran litterateur and re-
searcher, the late Ulloor S$. Parameswara Aiyer, in his article
“Kunavayirkottam and Vani”, (K.V. Rangaswami Aiyangar Commemoration
Volume, Madras, 1940, pp. 241-51). Identifying this with Vaiici, the capital

of the Cera kings of Kerala, he quotes two passages from early texts wherein
the name of the city is spelt only as Kotumkolir and not Kotumkallar.
Quoting from a 12-13th century Sanskrit-Tamil work in Manipravalam style,
he states :

Kollaviblitim kollum vibhavé niiru matannu ‘Kotunnolirilum’
ere vilannina pantupayata Kunavayakkuram api kunapam dadhati.

“It will be seen that the author begins from the south, and touches
Kollam (present-day Quilon), Kotunnolur (Kotumkolir, the modern
Kotunnallur, whose anglicised form is Cranganore), Kunavay etc.” (p. 242).

Later in the same article (p. 246) he refers to the occurrence of the
name of the city, again, as Kotunkolar. Further he refers to the early Tamil
classic Cilappatikaram and quotes from Atiyakkunallar, the commentator of
that classic: “Kunram, Kotunkolirkku ayalatakiya Cenkunrenum malai.” (p. 246,
fn. 13).

It should be amply clear from the above-given references that during
the time of Aryabhata (¢ AD 500), which is the time also of Cilappatikaram,
and, later too, the city was known only as Kotumkolir (“the city of stern
rule”) and not Kotumkallir (“the city of hard stones”), to give it any pos-
sibility of being equated with Asmaka.

The non-feasibility of Kerala being the Asmaka region is strengthened
by the fact that nowhere in the two works of Aryabhata, viz., Aryabhatiya
and the Aryabhatasiddhanta, Kerala has been referred to. More telling is the
fact that Aryabhata has concocted an extremely inconvenient system of
letter-numerals which he would not have done had he been aware of the
facile letter-numeral system of Katapayadi which was prevalent in Kerala
even before the time of Aryabhata. It might also be noted that even the
names of the three known disciples of Aryabhata, Pandurangasvami, Niganku
and Latadeva do not have any semblance of Keralite personal names, old
or new.

Equally fragile is the second reason adduced, viz., that Aryabhata should

have hailed from Kerala since, besides the Aryabhatan system being preva-
lent in this land, “all” commentaries on Aryabhatiya have been produced by

112 INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE

Kerala astronomers. This argument really does not stand scrutiny. For one
thing, though the Aryabhatiya and works on its basis are widely prevalent in
Kerala, the second work of Aryabhata, viz., Aryabhatasiddhanta is not known
in Kerala at all. The prevalence of Aryabyatiya also outside Kerala is vouched
by the fact of its being studied and commentaries thereof produced else-
where as well, both in Sanskrit and in the regional languages. Among the
non-Keralite commentators and commentaries and works based on the
Aryabhatiya the following may be mentioned:’

It is also to be noted that the second work of Aryabhata, viz.,
Aryasiddhdnta, is completely unknown in Kerala while it has influenced
astronomical writings in Andhra Pradesh, Northwest India, Iran and the
early Abbasid Caliphate.

In view of the above massive evidence, any claim that the study of
Aryabhatiya was carried on and that commentaries were written only in
Kerala, and therefore Aryabhata hailed from Kerala, loses all credibility.

KUSUMAPURA WHERE ARYABHATA FLOURISHED

Aryabhata states in the Aryabhatiya (Ganitapada, verse 1) that he was
setting forth in his work the knowledge that had been honoured in
Kusumapura. The following verse specifies that at a time when the results
computed through the then prevailing five astronomical schools (siddhantas)
(viz., Vasistha, Paitamaha, Pauliga, Romaka and Saura gave conflicting
results, Aryabhata, as the head of an institution (kulapa), set forth his
modified system of astronomical computation in Kusumapura:

siddhata-pancakavidhav api drgviruddha-
maudhyoparagamukha-khecaracarakiptau /
sturyah svayam Kusumapury abhavad kalau tu
bhigolavit kulapa Aryabhatabhidhanah //

114 INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE

“When the methods of the five Siddhantas began to yield results con-
flicting with the observed results as in the case of setting of the planets,
eclipses etc., there appeared in the Kali age, at Kusumapura, God Sun
himself in the form of Aryabhata, the Kulapa (‘head of an institution’) well
versed in astronomy.”

In spite of the well-known identification of Kusumapura with Pataliputra
(modern Patna), the capital of the ancient Magadha country (Bihar), sug-
gestions have been hazarded that if the Asmaka country could be identi-
fied as Kerala, Kusumapura can be identified with the township of
Pankunnam near Trichur and if Asmaka could be the same as Tamilnadu,
Kusumapura can be identified with Pampuhar on the east coast. The
puerile nature and far-fetchedness of both these suggestions would be ob-
vious when it is noted that they do not conform even to the literal mean-
ing of Kusumapura, “flower city”, since the two suggested words mean only
“flower hill” and “flower river-mouth”. There is neither an astronomical
tradition nor such an institution in these two places, to sustain the epithet
of Kulapa given to Aryabhata.

Indian tradition, Hindu and Buddhists, Puranic and historical, is loud
and clear in identifying Kusumapura with Pataliputra, the capital of
Magadha. In fact, Aryabhata’s follower Bhaskara I himself states in his
commentary on the Aryabhatiya that Kusumapura is Pataliputra. Thus, in
his commentary on Aryabhatiya (Ganitapada, verse 1), he explains
“Kusumapure ’ bhyarcitam jianam. Kusumapuram Pataliputram.” The Sanskrit
lexicons offer also alternate forms for both the names, viz., Kusumapura in
Hemacandra’s Abhidhanacintamani (133.976) and Puspapura in Kegava’s
Kalpadrukoga (10.18), Pataliputra in the Abhidhdnacintémani (133.976),
Pataliputraka in Purusottama’s Trikéndasesa and Pura in Hemacandra’s
Anekarthasangraha (36.450).°

CONCLUSION

What has been stated above would show that Aryabhata hailed from
the Asmaka country, which comprised the present South Gujarat and North
Maharashtra, through which the rivers Godavari and Narmada flowed. He
flourished at Pataliputra (modern Patna) in the ancient Magadha country
(now Bihar) where he composed his works, the Aryabhatiya and
Aryabhatasiddhanta. It may be recalled that the reputed University of Nalanda
was situated at Pataliputra and had an astronomical observatory (Kha-gola)
attached to it.!? Aryabhata who has been described as a Kudapa (“head of
institution”) could well have also been the head of the Nalanda University.

INDUS NUMERALS ON METAL TOOLS

J.S.PETTERSSON *

( Received 13 August 1998 )

Nine numerical inscriptions on metal tools from Chanhu-daro, Kalibangan and
Mohenjo-daro are shown to constitute a text genre of their own. It is tested
whether the expressions relate to the weights of the tools and/or to the contemporary
system of weight units. Both tests are negative. The number system appears as
octal on internal grounds. Structures of numerical systems are discussed
extensively.

Key words: Equation, Harappa culture, Octal number system, ‘t’-hypothesis,
Weight.

1. INTRODUCTION

Numerals in the Indus script has often been regarded as constituting a decimal
system; and for numeral inscriptions on utensils it has been suggested that they relate
to the weight or volume of the inscribed object (Mackay 1938: 454; Parpola 1986: 403;
1994: 107). A fragment of a ruler strongly supports the hypothesis of an ancient base
10 system for the measurement of length (Mackay 1938: 404; Mainkar 1984: 146).
However, when it comes to volume and weight the state of preservation of objects and/
or inscriptions precludes any direct conclusion.

The paper will rely on some arguments based on internal evidence’of the numerical
system (Pettersson 1996:801) and bring in two specimens from Kalibangan which do
not seem to have been considered before. The arguments speak against a decimal
interpretation of what is most clearly numerals in the Indus script and also against the
supposition that inscriptions of metal-ware relate to weight ( the relation between
volume and numerals on pottery will not be considered because of the lack of reliable
material).

Terminology
Bold face u and i (and t) denote possible numerals which look like horse shoes

(opening downwards) and strokes (strokes in tilted rows are designated with a t).

Multiple occurrences of a symbol u, i or t will be indicated with a digit; é. g. 6i means
Hdd.

90 INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE

Italicized u, i, and f are used to denote possible numerical values of numerais u, i
and t. These hypothetical values are sometimes system internal i-e., they show how the
numerals relate to each other, sometimes external in that they relate to weight.

While standardization of inscriptions ease the work of the decipherer, it is
important not to obfuscate any difference in form which could potentially reveal
difference in function. The use here of a special transliteration letter, t instead of i, for
strokes arranged in rows running at an angle to other rows of strokes should be seen as
an attempt to overcome the weakness of a sequential rendering of symbol forms
( Koskenniemi and Parpola, 1982, where an inscription Iu 5i 4t is tendered as U Ill
Ill). Reference numbers from lists of standardized texts have rarely been used here
(except in a table in sec. 6 for cross-reference); instead references are made to
publications where the relevant texts have been depicted in some way.

On the other hand, in seal inscriptions (which are the most common Indus script
remains) and in inscriptions on copper and clay tablets (which are quite frequent too)
one finds both long and short strokes, but this difference is not captured by the notation
adopted here. The reason is simply that this difference does not seem to occur in the kind
of numerical expressions the present study is concerned with (for a comment of the
variation in the use of long and short strokes, see Parpola 1994: 82).

A numeral system in which different numbers are expressed by grouping of
symbols is called additive. Historically, this is a very common way of expressing
numbers. Since the Indus script displays many graphic units consisting of a number of
strokes, it seems reasonable to assume that these units express numbers. In some cases,
other symbols than the simple strokes are repeated or strokes appear in different
groupings. It is very common in additive systems to express different magnitudes with
different symbols; cf. Roman I,V,X,L,C,D,M. This is called sign-value notation Thus,
it might be the case that the u, i, and t o1 Indus metals were part ofa sign-value notation.

In some sign-value systems, small numerals denote the number of the bigger units
of the system (perhaps weight or volume units ) and these systems are then called
multiplicative. If the purely additive XXX I in the Roman notation instead was written
as III X TW (=3 x 10+ 2), this would be an example of a multiplicative notation. (for more
on the terminology for numerical notations, see Pettersson 1996.)

2. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NUMERICAL EXPRESSIONS

The numerical expressions treated here are distinguished not only by being incised
on metal tools but also because they are not included in Jonger inscriptions but forming,
as it seems, a separate message from the other inscriptions occurring on these objects.
To the author’s knowledge, excavators have found only eight copper or bronze tools
inscribed with numerals arranged in this way (‘ numerals’= what one would suppose
to be numerals from repetitions characteristic of additive systems or, in the case of K~

INDUS NUMERALS ON METAL TOOLS 91

122 discussed in section 3, from resemblance to forms occurring repetitively in other
inscriptions). One of these contains a problematic numeral and will be treated in this
section only, as will also a ninth object with an odd but interesting numerical expression
which is used here to justify the identification of a special class of numerical
expressions.

The numerical inscriptions of all nine objects are tabulated in section 6.

Two objects from Chanhujo-dara: C-40 and C-39

A broken axe from Chanhujo-daro (C-40 in CISI 1, Joshi and Parpola 1987;
Mackay 1943: 178), inscribed on both sides which on its A side bears two numerical
expressions within a single, horizontal line of text (‘horizontal’ as judged from the
individual signs which include a standing man). One of these is just an ordinary text-
6: two rows of three small strokes, the whole compound made to fit neatly within the
line of the text. The other expression looks more like the free-standing expressions
found on the other tools: (possibly)5i on top of a column of 3u i.e. a vertical
arrangement. Only one or two of the w’s fit into the horizontal text line, while the bottom
wand the top row of i’s fall outside this line.(Again, this is not represented in lists of
texts; see Mahadevan 1977: 557, text 6306, and Koskenniemi and Parpola 1982: 95,
text 5075).

The very fact that this numerical expression, which looks like the others that are
considered here, runs vertical in an otherwise horizontal text, motivates the treatment
of all these expressions as a special category. However, since this particular numerical
expression is in fact included in a text, it might be risky to regard it as the same as the
ones considered here. In any event, the axe is broken and Mackay (1943) does not give
its weight.

An ingot also from Chanhujo-daro (C-39 in CISI 1; Mackay 1943:187) displays a
column of XXUUU. If this U is the u treated here, then, since the openings of the Us
are towards the Xs, the Xs should be numerals ‘on the other side’ of u as compared to
i (.e., x>u>i or x<u<i). Mackay does not give the weight of this object. Because of this
and because it contains possible numerals of a sort, viz. X (actually a double triangle;
Parpola’s sign no. 234; 1994: 75), not found on the other specimens, it will not be
brought into the calculations made here although it is very tempting to take an ingot to
be marked as a weight !

Implications

The very fact that a special ‘text genre’ of numeral expressions exists on metal tools
and that an ingot was marked by a series of numerals is really suggestive; it speaks pro
the hypothesis that numerals were used to indicate weight. However, no numerals have
been found on the always very carefully made weight units (see esp. sec. 6 below). In
the rest of this paper. numerals on metal tools will be compared with the weights of the

92 INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE

tools themselves as well as with systems of weight units from the Indus Civilization;
they will also be evaluated system- internally. The evidence collected in this way
actually speaks against the hypothesis that numerals were used to indicate weight. The
reason for why toel-numerals were inscribed in such a distinct way is, however, not
revealed by this investigation.

Ttcould be mentioned that it has been suggested that numerals on copper implements
are in fact inventory numbets (Mackay 1943: 178; Parpola 1986: 403). This is of course
very hard to check since no slab incised with a list of items has been found. Such a
hypothesis could probably best be supported by comparative evidence from other
cultures of the same age, while the relation of numerals to weight (or, for vessels, to
volume) should be testable by purely culture- internal evidence.

3. EVIDENCE FROM KALIBANGAN: K-121 and K-122

There are two copper tools from Kalibangan in C/S/ 1 (Joshi and Parpola 1987)
which possibly bear numerical inscriptions: a chisel (K-121) and an axe (K-122). The
‘recto’ sides bear miscellaneous signs while the ‘verso’ sides bear almost only
numerals. In this they parallel DK-7856 (chisel) and DK-7835 (axe) from Mohenjo-
daro which will be discussed in a separate section below. Both K-121 and DK-7856
have their inscriptions on the tang which makes it unlikely that if these inscriptions
referred to weight, the intention was to include the weight of the shaft as well (of course,
the expensiveness of the metal as compared to the probably wooden shaft makes this
unlikely in any case). The same assumption will be made concerning the axe blades.

The number and the art of the numerals on K-121B may be disputed and there are
numerals also on the ‘recto’ side K-121A. Since this complicates the matter, the
discussion of it will be postponed until later in the present section. Similarly, K-122B
may have contained more signs than those easily discernible on the photographs in CIS
1 (p.326). The arguements needed to deal with this possibility are somewhat different
from the ones employed for the comparison of K-121 and K-122, and they will be
presented in the next section.

The relationship between i and u in K-121B and K-122B

Initially the following possible sign- forms and weights will be recognized for the
two Kalibangan objects (the weights have kindly been supplied by B.M. Pande, New
Delhi through Asko Parpola, Helsinki):

K-12 weighs 210g and K-121B reads 2u or 1u (+ some other sign);

K-122 weighs 476g and K-122B reads Si.

Since u andi are not mixed in the two numerical expressions, it is a very simple task
to relate these symbols to the weight of the two objects:

INDUS NUMERALS ON METAL TOOLS 93

u = either 125g or 210g; and

i = 95.2g (this is of course 476g /5).

Now it will be seen that if i and u belong to the same system, the relationship
between them will be rather awkward. One would expect a relationship expressible
with a whole integer. We get u/ i= 1.1 or = 2.2; some of this might be explained by
corrosion and wearing, but a relation like u / i =1 begs the question why different
numerals were used at all and u/ i =2 begs the question why the larger unit, u, was not
used on the more heavy object to express its weight as 2u li.

Admittedly, there is one possible explanation to all this, namely that u and i were
used in conjunction with different sets of weight units. On the Mohenjo-Daro objects
however, u and i appear in the same inscriptions—a fact which seemingly precludes
that they belonged to different systems of weight, but one should not rush too quickly
here; Hemmy (1938) established two (or possible three) parallel decimal series of
weight units (extending from a binary system comprising units of circa 30 grammes and
less), and these series were related to each other by a factor 2. Thus, two series of weight
units could be referred by the two different numeral shapes. But it should be added that
there is nothing that shows that the two series of weight units were not used together-
rather, it seems probable that half-weights were used to quickly establish the precise
weight of an object (compare the use in our own culture of 5-grammes weight units,
and even 2-grammes and 3-grammes!; compare also our monetary systems where coins
and notes align to a decimal system but not only at every power of ten but we may have,
as in Britain, 1,2,5, and 10,20,50, pence and pounds, respectively).

Thus, the absence of the larger unit u on the heavier object speak against a relation
of the numerals to weight.

Interpreting one of the u of K- 121B as 2i

Because one of the signs on K-121B looks very bad when regarded as a u, it should
be considered if it is another relevant sign. However, there is no idea to invent a third
type of numeral here, since that would not solve the mystery of why the heavier object,
K-122, lacks one of the number signs appearing on K-121 (viz., u or the third type). On
the other hand, interpreting it as a number of strokes, perhaps 2i, on which some
incisions have been made accidentally, will make it possible to capture the bulk of the
weights by a symbol also appearing on K- 122, namely i. The calculations would run
as (presuming 2i):

K-121 weighs 210g and K-121B reads 1u 2i;

K-122 weighs 476g and K-J22B reads Si.

With i = 95.2g this implies 210 = u + 190.4, which yields u = 19.6g.

Here we get an interesting tilt of the relationship between u and i: inow becomes
the larger unit. The proportion i/u is 4.9 but the exact relationship is hard to say anything

94 INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE

about since the axe blade seems in addition to corrosion to have suffered from some
wearing which might suggest an original weight of about 500g and with 5i = 500g, u
will be only 10g and i/u will be 10.

(Below, when solving a similar set of equations for the Mohenjo-darp objects, the
result is however u>i.)

Other number signs on K-121

The ‘recto’ side of the chisel from Kalibangan contains 2i and above these there
might be an u ( in the beginning or end of the inscription). Following the 2i there is a
‘fish’ sign with and ‘index’ 2i at one of its side incised with two short parallel strokes
somewhat slanted as if to fit graphically next to the fish’s fin (not so in the Finnish
corpus, text 7080, but cp. C/S/ 1). It seems thus as if the normal-sized 2i constitute a
specification to the fish sign. Furthermore, one should bear in mind that the numerals
on the other Kalibangan object are found solely on one side. Nevertheless, this
expression will be considered here.

Theve are some problems when interpreting the numerical symbols on K-121A.

First, it is uncertain if it reads 2i or lu 2i.

Secondly, since the possible u is at one end in the inscription (and rather near the
end of the object) it might be that the (possible) numerical expression runs over to the
other side, i.e. to K- 121B, although there is space enough after the possible u for the
whole of the B inscription. In case the inscriber intended a continuous text the whole
expression is either 2i + 3u, or 4i + 2u if the alternative reading of the B side as 1u 2i
is used. Both of these expressions are unlikely: 2i + 3u imply that the ancient
Kalibangans would have incised u in three different ways even when the u’s appeared
next to each other, and 47+ 2u with alterning i’s and u’s instead of heaping each symbol
(magnitude) is never found in sign-value systems (actually, one could say that the users
of such systems anticipated what is done by necessity in positional systems). Furthermore,
it should be observed that the numerals ought not to be a part of a multiplicative system
since u appear in two places as well as i.

Moreover, if the A side contains only 2i and no-u, it might be the case that the last
symbol is a unit (6f which we have two, as indicated by 2i), and, again, there is a
possibility that the expression continues on the ‘verso’ side. On that side we may count
with another unit (perhaps x times bigger / smaller than the first one ), so that we have
only one u there. (The units are then redundant since different numerals are used to
express their respective number. For an abstract system of numerals, this would perhaps
be unlikely, but we are now testing the hypothesis that numerals relate to weight and
this, it could be argued, make redundant notation less unlikely.)

As a last possibility we get 2i+ unit sign on A, and 2u without unit sign on B ( this
is not unlikely in principle because there could have been a standard unit associated with
numeral wu).

INDUS NUMERALS ON METAL TOOLS 95

We then get the following five possible expressions for K-121 (disregarding the B-
side numerals when they do not belong to an expression partly found on the A side), of
which only the first two or three are (modestly) possible on graphical grounds:

K-121A (+B): 2i, 2i + u or 2i + 2u; but hardly 2i + 3u or 41 + 2u;

K- 122B: Si.

Reading only 2é yields i = 105g which contradicts the Si on K-122B, But
considering the wear and corrosion of K-122, an original weight 5 x 105g = 525g is
perhaps not out of the question, but K- 121 too might have been somewhat heavier than
its present 210g which implies a higher value of i than 105g.

Reading 2i +1u yields the same set of equations as found in the last subsection, and
the result is very much like a 2i reading (u = 10-20g).

Finally, for the third possibility, 2i + 2u yields u = 9.8g.

Inall, the hypothesis that the A side of the chisel K-12] contains relevant numerals
cannot be refuted by pure calculations. However, as indicated in the beginning of this
subsection, there-are graphical arguments against it.

In sum

The problem with an interpretation of the numerals on K-121B and K-122B as
indicating weight is the fact that the two expressions on the two B-sides contain
different numerals such that the bigger one, u, is not present on the heavier object (the
axe K-122).

Adding i’s to the lighter object (the chise] K-121) makes u a small numeral as
compared to i and it is possible to establish a relation between numerals and weight
without any embarrassing over-use of a smaller sign to express a heavy weight. There
are, however, problems of a graphical sort when one reads i’s into possible numerical
expressions of K-121.

As for the solution into grammes, two things should be observed: (1). the values are
uncertain because of the state of preservation of the objects; and (2). it should also be
noted that solving a system of equations consisting of two equations and two unknown
(here: u and i) will always yield a solution (provided, i.e., the equations are neither
‘linear dependent’ as mathematicians call it nor contradicting each other). This
solvability does not prove the solution to reveal any facts about the ancient use of these
numerals. At least a third object, and thus a third equation, is needed to ‘verify’ (support)
the mathematical solution of two unknown, as explained in a short paper by the author
(Pettersson 1994).

If there were more obyects ( preferably from each site and each excavation level),
then so-called regression analyses could be made to fit numerals ‘on an average’ to
weights of objects and statistical analyses could be performed for estimating the
probability that numerals and weights relate to each other by intention rather than by
pure chance. As it is, the scarcity of the inscribed implements and their state of
preservation make it necessary to use other methods.

4. Mors SIGNS ON K-122B?

The surface of the axe K-122 is partly very corroded. Judging from the photographs
in CIS/ 1, p. 326, the corrosion on the A side is deep enough to have possibly eliminated
signs inscribed before the corrosion started. The B side, i.e. the one bearing the five
strokes here denoted as 5i, is perhaps equally badly corroded; could there possibly have
been other inscisions than the ones visible? One should not attempt to settle that
question without an examination of the original objects, but the following observations
introducing a different principle can anyhow be worthwhile to make.

Alignment to a system of weight units

Hemmy’s (1938) two parallel, decimal series for weight units consist of units like
137g and 274g. If u and i related to weight, one would assume that they were direct
reflections of the system of weight units. Admittedly, only a few units of this magnitude
has been found, while tenths and smaller fractions (which constitute a binary system)
are more frequent; there could have been quite another system of units for metal-ware.
In any event, the system established by Hemmy is what we have, and it is instructive
to try to align the values of u and i to it. (In Marshall, 1931, Hemmy presents further
possible units but few actual specimens are assigned to these classes.)

The valuei =95.2g ( or = 100g) inferred from K-122 does not match the system well
at all: the nearest weight units are 2 x 27.4g = 54.8g and 137g. Assuming that i
corresponds to the weight unit of 137g (since K-122 has lost some weight since it was
made) is tantamount to ascribe an original weight of 5x 137g = 685g to this axe blade
and that it has lost 685 - 476= 209 grammes through wear and tear. This seems unlikely
from the photos of an overall well preserved axe in C/S/ 1.

Assuming that K-122B is so corroded that the specimen has lost numerals once
inscribed upon it, one should test whether additions of numerals to the expression Si will
fit the weight system, i.e., whether such additions will make the expression to sum up
to=500g while the numerals take their values only from Hemmy’s series.

Introducing more i’s makes it possible to approach units like 27.4g and 54.8g: e.g.
500 / 54.8 = 9.1 (476 / 54.8 = 8.7), that is to say that i = 54.8g would imply nine
occurrences of i and an original weight at 490g.

The surface of the axe in the vicinity of the 5i does not seem to allow for more i’s,
however (see esp. the photo of these strokes in 200% of actual size in CIS/ 1, p. 326).
Looking at the Mohenjo-daro objects where both i and u show up, one will find that
the u’s are not aligned to the row (s) of i’s. What is more, on DK- 7835, an axe blade,
the u’s actually forms a column at some distance from the row of simple strokes. (on
the other object, DK-7856, the tang of a chisel, there is only one u.)

It could thus bé hypothesized - very tentatively- that there was once. a column of u’s
on K-122B. Letting u <i will imply that the five to nine i’s carry most of the weight and

INDUS NUMERALS ON METAL TOOLS 97

u only a portion which is impossible to determine nowadays because of the wear and
tear of the object (at least if its original shape cannot be very accurately determined).
Letting u > i, u should be fitted to the weight units closest to the weight of K-122 to
minimize the number of reconstructed numerals; thus u = 137 or 274 grammes. Of
course, if u corresponds to the 137-grammes unit, then there is reason to suppose that
it occurred thrice-on K-122B since 3x 137 = 411 < 500 (476). Calculating along these
lines we have ni (where n >= 5 because there are 5ion K- 122B nowadays, so there were
probably at least 5i on K-122B originally), to take care of the remaining weight:

500 (476) - 411 or 274 = 89(65) or 226 (202) grammes.

There is a weight unit of 13.7g and taken five times it would represent a weight of
68.5 grammes. This seems to fit in nicely, since this makes i a tenth of wu = 137g. For
the larger u value, i.e. u=274g, i=27.4g would imply eight i’s, since 8 x 27.4=219.2,
while atwice as big icorresponding to a not infrequent weight unit of 54.8g would imply
four i’s which does not conform with the five which are actually there.

The above calculations seem to suggest that u andirelate to weight and furthermore
that u/i =10. However, it must be remembered that these calculations were made with
several extra numerals tentatively added to K-122B and that the fit to Hemmy’s series
of weight units was facilitated by the lack of a precise value for K- 122’s original weight.
Nevertheless, this section has demonstrated how one can go about to delimit the
possible range of enigmatic numerals when one aims at interpreting such numerals
in‘real’ terms (here in grammes) . Another kind of delimitation would aim merely at the
numerical relations between the numerals ; this would still give idea of the structure of
the numeral system, as will be demonstrated in section 6 below.

5, EVIDENCE FROM MOHENJO-DARO:DK-7856 AND DK-7835

Yet another set of one chisel and one axe willnow be considered. DK-7856 and DK-
7835 both come from Mohenjo -daro together with some other inscribed bronzes which
will be introduced in the text section. DK-7856 is actually only the tang of a broken
chisel. The axe blade is fairly well preserved according to the excavator but he also says
about this axe and some other specimen that “they were found corroded together into
a mass and could only be separated in a chemical bath, which, naturally has reduced
their weight considerably”(Mackay 1938: 454). If Mackay had weighed the whole mass
before the bath it would have been possible to estimate each specimen’s contribution
to the total weight from their reduced individual weights (perhaps including each
object’s surface area in the calculations). Unfortunately, Mackay does not seem to haye
taken this step before the mass was let into the chemical bath (p.c. Michael Jansen, June
25, 1997).

In section 3, tentative values of u and i were given by solving a system of equations
with two unknown. The same procedure will now be used to establish the values of 1

98 INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE

and j in relation to the weights of the Mohenjo-daro chisel and axe. Furthermore, one
could try to match the numerals against the weight units established by Hemmy, as was
done in section 4 for Kalibangan inscriptions where both existing and tentatively added
numerals were tested. Here, we will not add any numerals.

Of course, since DK- 7856 is merely the tang of a broken chisel, the weight of the
whole chisel can only be estimated rather roughly. But it is also important to make
calculations based on the actual specimen, the tang that is, because when it was broken
it could very well have been marked as to weigh for the purpose of remoulding.

The relation between i and u in DK-7856 (tang) and DK-7835

DK-7856 weights 165.343g and the numerals reads u 5i 4t;

DK- 7835 weights 1910.030g and the numerals read 7u 6i.

The following’system of equations can be set up.

u+5i+4r= 165g

Ju + 6i = 1910g

This gives negative value of i: when neglecting t (since ¢ might be fairly small as
a fraction of 1), this system yields i = -26g, u = 295g.

The tilted row of four strokes, which has here been designated by 4t, should perhaps
be interpreted simply as 4i; then the numerical expression DK-7856 reads u 9i. With
t= i, one gets i =~ 13.25g,u = 284g.

A negative value of i simple means that one preferred to indicate first the nearest
higher unit and then how much should be subtracted from it by the lesser units; cp.
Roman IX for 9 (10-1). On the other hand, it seems strange to give, for the tang, its
weight by taking its double weight and then subtracting by its weight, which is what the
first equation says! If the original chisel’s weight was u, this seems more reasonable,
but could a similar argument be made for the axe?

Instead, one may attempt an alignment to Hemmy’s system of weight units: the two
inscriptions, u Si 4t for the lighter object and 7u 6i for the heavier, suggest that the
numeral u stands for a heavier weight unit than does i and t regardless of whether i and
t should be regarded as equipollent. There seems then to be two weight units of which
u could possibly be a mark for, viz. the units at circa 137g and 274g.

The tang weighs 165b and contains one u, so, with positive i, u may stand for the
weight unit at 137g, which leaves 28g to be accounted for by 5i 4t. However, for the
other object, 7u accounts for only half the actual weight since 7 x 137g = 959g, which
leaves 6i to represent too much (not even by assuming u = i much is gained, since 13
x 137g = 1781g which is less than what the actual specimen weighs nowadays).

Alternatively, one may aim at the next larger unit, i.e. 274g. This will imply that the
smaller unit must be negative. This is by no means impossible: the men holding the
balance simple had to put the i-units in the same pan as the tang, while the 274g-unit

INDUS NUMERALS ON METAL TOOLS 99

was in the other pan of the balance. For the two possibilities i # t and i=1 one could set
i = 27.4g andi = 13.7, respectively. However, the predicted values will be less than
the actual weights of the corroded and weared objects:

Tang 274¢ - 5 x 27.4g = 137g or (¢ = i) 274 - 9 x 13.7g = 150.72

Axe 7 x 274g - 6x 27.4g = 1754g or 7 x 274g - 6 x 13.7g = 1836g

In conclusion, then the numeral inscription of DK-7856 does not seem to be a
numerical expression for the weight of the tang. Almost certainly it is not a numerical
expression for the weight of the tang as measured by the standard Indus weight units
as established by Hemmy. The rest of section 5 will deal with computations based on
a reconstruction of the original, unbroken chisel.

Estimating the original proportion between chisel and tang of DK-7856

One has to establish the shape of the object before any estimation is possible of how
much is missing. According to Mackay (1938: 473) there are five types of chisels which
he denotes by letters, (a)-(e). From the photograph and the drawings of the tang in
Mackay’s report it seems likely that the tang belonged to class (b): “rectangular or
square in section, with flattened tang”. Mackay does indeed discuss it under this
subheading (pp. 473-474). The present author further makes the observation that what
one could call the ‘bridge’ between the flattened tang and the (now lost) square part is
quite short as compared to many type-(b) chisels. Looking for ‘short-bridged’ (b)-
chisels to find a proportion p between tang and the whole length, no 5 in Mackay’s PI.
CXIV and some specimen on Marshall’s Pl. CKX XV (1931, vol. IIL) indicate that p <
2.6 (Mackay’s own guess of the original length- unsupported by arguments- and his
tabulation of actual length (p.489) yields a proportion of 2.87. One object, no. 6 found
in Mackay’s PI.CX VII, has the proportion 2.83 but the length of its tang is less then half
of DK-7856.)

The thickness throughout any of the chisels seems to be rather uniform, except that
the tang may be somewhat flattened; at the same time, the tang is broader than the rest
of the chisel. Therefore, the original weight of DK-7856 was probably somewhat less
than 2.6 times its actual weight; it could have been less than twice its present weight.

The relation between i and u in DK-7856 (chisel) and DK-7835

The following system of equations (or, rather, system of one equation and one
inequality) can now be set up.

u+5it4t<px 165g, p= 2.6

Tu + 61 = 1910g

Solving this, one will eventually get 37.69 >i+ 4/29 ¢.

Thus, i<38g if tis not negative (in fact, even if it is, the upper bound fo é would
probably be somewhere in the vicinity of 38 since ¢ is scaled down by 4/ 29).

u > 240g (provided that ¢ is non-negative).

100 INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE

(With p = 2.8 one gets i < 45.66g and u > 233.68g.)

With 7 = i one gets i < 33.13g and u > 244 46g.

The result of these computations obviously conflict with the result obtained for the
Kalibangan numerals.

One could also in this case ask for a match with Hemmy’s system of weight units.
u above 240g suggests u = 274g and then the ‘nearest’ unit fori will be the one at 27.4g.
Substituting these two values for u and i in the above system one gets:

274g +5x 274g + 4t<2.6x 165g <=> 411g + 4t < 4292

7 x 274g + 6x 27.42 = 1910g <=> 2082.4p = 1910g (!)

That is, the axe in its present state weighs some 170g too little. If this is explainable
by the chemical bath and wear is hard to judge from the report.

Finally, looking at the extreme values for u and i as calculated above, we get some
hints of possible relations between u and i: u/i>240/37.7 > 6.3, which one could have
guessed since the numerical expression on DK-7835 reads 7u 6i which makes it
unlikely that u could replace 6i, 5i, or less. But it is far from clear that the relation u/
i equalled 10, as is tacitly assumed when u and i are regarded as weight indicators and
aligned to Hemmy’s system of weight units. Notably though, one gets no contradiction
from the assumption that t = 7, because then u/:>7.37 which is a sound value since there
are then 9: in one and the same expression, which suggests that u/i >9.

However, one may ask whether it is sound to interpret a tilted row of i’s as just
another row ofi’s. To answer this, itis necessary to take a look at text- internal evidences
to find out the nature to the Indus system of numerals (or of what appears to be a system).
So far, six numerical inscriptions have been scrutinized. Three more will be treated in
the next section—they differ from the four last ones in not being inscribed on the other
side although one of them has a few apparently non-numerical signs on the ‘numerical’
side.

6. MoRE EVIDENCE FROM MOHENIO-DARO

Of the nine objects considered in the present study, two comes from Chanhujo-
daro, two from Kalibangan, and five from Mohenjo-daro; four of the latter ones were
found together “at the low level-24.4 ft.” (Mackay 1938: 454; vol. If, Pl. CKXVI # 2,
3, and 5, Pl. CXX VII # 1, Pl.. CXXXD) and one, a heavily corroded copper knife, was
found “18.4 ft. below datum” (p. 454, n. 4, and p. 463; vol., Pl. CX XXIII # 1). Listing
the possibly numerical inscriptions of these objects will reveal an interesting structuring
principle for Indus numerals. The following list starts with the two Chanhujo-daro
objects briefly discussed in section 2; then it continues with the copper knife mentioned
last followed by the rest of the Mohenjo-daro objects, and finally the list ends with the
two Kalibangan objects. (The third Column to Host Text Corpus No.s. Finnish

The four last objects are inscribed on the other side too, the axe and the tang from
Mohenjo-daro with the same sequence of signs, a sequence also found ona seal and in
an impression of another seal (Parpola 1994: 108). The tang furthermore bears two
signs on the ‘numerical’ side. The other axe from Mohenjo-daro, DK- 7855, has three
signs on the ‘numerical’ side, one close to the six strokes ( it is the common terminal
sign, see Parpola 1994:65, 82ff) which makes it difficult to extract this numerical
expression from the rest of the inscription; the leftmost stroke is furthermore slightly
lower than the other five. In any event, an equation 6i = 262g conflicts with the
(competing) solutions obtained for the last four items in the list.

For the internal evidences as regards the structure of the (possible) numerical
system, it is noteworthy that the expression 7i 4t on DK-7857 excludes the possibility
that the two equalities t = i and w/i= 10 both hold true. Mackay says “Perhaps a duo
- decimal system” when commenting on the “no less than eleven digits.” (1938: 454),
but to introduce a 12- system here is not necessary. It is better to observe that whenever
there are tilted rows of strokes these tilted rows contain four ‘digits’. There are two
interpretations of this (except for the one where t is regarded as the same as i, which
leaves unexplained the fact why four strokes should be written in a tilted row):

One being that ‘four strokes’ had become a mark for something which the other
numerals (i.e. i and u) counted, simply because the numeral i often occurred in such
specifications. The 4t is then simply an icon standing for “here comes numerals for .....”
but it is not a numerical expression itself. This interpretation can explain why there are
‘always’ (at least in the only three instances treated here) four t and neither more nor
less (even the case of not’s at all is explained by the icon-interpretation: the sign 4t was
after all quite redundant). One can note that in Parpola’s sign list (see e.g. 1994), there

102 INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE

is a sign with a man ‘holding’ (being connected to ) four strokes, but otherwise the four-
strokes group does not seem to have any special status as compared to other groups of
strokes. There is thus not much support for or against a non- numerical interpretation
4t in the rest of the Indus text corpus.

The other interpretation is the one used throughout the present study, namely that
t stands for a number and that it has a specific, numeric relation to i and u. Now it may
seem unexplainable why the t’s should always occur four together. However, there is
one system in which this would be quite natural, namely in an octal system. If i/t
=8(regardless of what w/t equals), then 4t means ‘half ani’. If there is one magnitude
of some privilege status, the halves of the magnitude should be rather privileged too.
The most privileged magnitude would probably be indicated with the simplest sign, the
stroke (cp. our numeral 1, Roman I, etc.; Pettersson 1996), because this would be the
most common sign.

How does the assertion i/t = 8 fit the hypothesis that the numerals indicate weight?
Surprisingly well, since as already mentioned above the double (or triple) decimal
series of weight units is an extension of a binary system. The units 13.7g and 27.4¢ (and
54.8g) constitute the start of the decimal series but also the end of the binary series.
These weight units were the ones fitting iin most of the cases accounted for in the above
calculations. Sadly, it would be impossible to test this by weight equations of the kind
used above, since r as a fraction of i would fall within the uncertainties plaguing these
calculations due to the state of preservation of the objects bearing inscriptions.

Stil, it must be remembered that the solutions of equations presented above did not
give values of u and i close to the weight units of Hemmy’s system and it is time to
question whether the numeral system really is of the same structure as the one proposed
by Hemmy for weight units. Looking at the nine numerical expressions again, a quite
striking feature is that neither the number of i’s nor the number of u’s exceed seven.
This suggests that the whole numeral system was octal (probably such that, with *
denoting a possible higher magnitude than u, *> u>i>t,ie.*/u=u/i=i/t=8). This
is indeed supported by other inscriptions from the Indus culture: the frequency list given
by Mahadevan (1977: 718) shows that sign consisting solely of strokes commonly
contain 1-7 strokes, very rarely 8-10 (although a special 12-sign, written as 3 x 4i, is
quite frequent). The fact that groups of more than seven strokes, appear sometimes
indicates merely that for some purposes, numbers greater than seven could be indicated
by strokes. But thenormal employment of stroke-numerals were within an octal system.

The same seems to hold for more curviformed numerals. Fairservis (1992)
observes that semicircles, which he calls crescents because he lumps together at least
three sign forms, viz.), ‘U’, and u, never exceed the number of 7, which suggests “that
eight was again the critical number” (1992:69). He also suggests that different orders
between crescents and strokes indicate different uses—additive and multiplicative. It

INDUS NUMERALS ON METAL TOOLS 103
seems, though, as if there are no clear inscriptions like iiiciiii (¢ for crescent; cp. text
3274, Finnish Corpus) and only a few IITATIII where A is another sign (e.g. text 1471).
It could be worth mentioning that he furthermore claims to have identified some
pictographic signs as standing for 8-12 and suggests that these were used to denote
months, but it should be added that these are very tentative identifications.

The numerals and number words used by a people rarely fit well—a point made by
Menninger (1969:53)-—and consequently there are in the present connection reasons
to avoid comparisons with languages possibly spoken by the ancient users of the Indus
script. Fairservis (op. cit.) does try to decipher the entire Indus script by reference to sign
forms and homonyms in Dravidain proto-languages. While his self- proclaimed ability
to see what the stylized pictograms depict and his quickness to present homonyms from
different languages may repel many a reader, it should be noted that his observation that
eight was “a critical number” is based on a quite uncontroversial sign count.

The method of counting individual sign forms can be combined with a count of co-
occurrences between different signs, as has been done by Kak (1988: 142, 1989: 116,
1990) who claims that u never appears together with more than four strokes which
implies a quinary system. However, as is evident from the list presented above, Si and
6i actually do pair with u in some inscriptions.

It might be foolish to mix different kinds of texts—especially since the possibly
numerical inscriptions on metal tools stand apart from other inscriptions on the very
same objects—and in the present study the numerical inscriptions on metal tools have
constituted a littte corpus of their own, and only after analyzing this have references
been made to a larger corpus of Indus inscriptions. The latter evidence could primarily
be used only supportive, because if for instance eight and nine strokes were common
signs in ordinary Indus texts, that would not necessarily speak against an octal
interpretation of tool numerals; two systems could have been in use simultaneously. In
the present study, moreover, drawings and photographs of inscription have been
inspected instead of mere standardized corpus lists. this have made it possible to launch
the ‘t’ - hypothesis, i.e., that strokes incised in different ways may be tokens of different
types, perhaps of different numerals.

Octal weight measures?

Considering the fact that the numerals seem to form aconsistent octal system, could
the weight units be re-evaluated so that the decimal part of the system starts somewhat
later than at 13.7 grammes? if the weight-unit value for i obtained from the Mohenjo
-daro chisel (as reconstructed from the tang) and axe is used to guess the u-value under
the assumption the u/i=8, then u=8 27.4g=219.2g. This does not match the existent
weight units welLand what is more, the inscription on the axe must now be taken to
indicate only 1700g which is less than its present-day weight. This again suggests that

104 INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE

numerals did not relate to weight, at least not to the weight units as interpreted by
Hemmy. :

There is one ‘text-internal’ thing that speaks for a relation to weight. If there is a
higher magnitude than u, let’s again denote it by *, and */u=8, then he DK-7835 axe
inscription could be interpreted as that* units of metal were used to make DK-7835, but
in the process, 2i was lost, which was noted on the axe after a control weighing (1* -
2i = 7u + 6)! Such a use of standard weights for axe-making is not impossible even if
the standard does not conform to the ordinary series of weight units. Tentatively then,
one would have * = 2Kg, and indeed K-122 weighs a fourth of that which could be taken
as supporting evidence for a * standard. However, the third axe weighs more than an
eighth, so this case-seems closed even without a look on other axes than the more three
used here.

Parenthetically in could be mentioned that binary relations between lengths are
found in the Indus civilization. Bricks, while sometimes of different size at different
sites and even within one site, all have internal proportions 4:2; ] between length : width:
height in the mature Indus civilization while in the formative phase bricks show the
proportions 3:2:1 and bricks from other cultures may have no simple, whole-number
relations between their sides (see Thapar 1985,pp. 53-83 for pre and mature Indus
civilization and p. 91 for the more or less cotemporaneous Ahar culture). This
adherence to binary relations between lengths is a bit surprising in the light of the
(possibly) decimal ruler mentioned in the Introduction but by no means incompatible
with it.

Hemmy’s system of weight units

Mainkar (1984)-—~drawing on finds from Lothal (Rae 1973; not read by the present
author)—questions the existence of a binary subsystem of weight units and suggests
instead two different (triple) decimal series. If the suggestion turns out to be the best
description of Indus weight units, then it is even less likely than indicated above that
the numerals relate to weight or at least to weight units. But it is noteworthy that
Mainkar has to leave out one weight class at 6.829g identified by Hemmy. This might
be seen as no big issue since some odd examples puzzle even Hemmy. However, the
unit left out by Mainkar were represented by 45 specimens clustered around 6.829g.
These are too many not to be included in the systems proposed by Mainkar.

Hemmy used statistical methods to test the overall system: he ascribed each
specific specimen to a unit and then normalized all the units to one unit to be able to
detect deviation from the proposed binary+double-decimal system. He got a nice
Gaussian curve for the whole set (which included only perfectly or near perfectly
preserved specimen). Actually, he managed to detect a little peak—a small Gaussian
curve in itself-—with its mean value near the overall mean value; this indicates that at
some time, a slightly false unit was made in Mohenjo-daro or Harappa and then some

INDUS NUMERALS ON METAL TOOLS 105

other tokens at both sites were made with this one as the norm.(For an often considered
magnitude in the present study, this ‘false’ standard is = 13.95g, which makes the
corresponding original or dominant standard to 13.6g instead of the 13.7g used above.)
For Chanhujo-daro, Hemmy reports that: “There is a single maximum, so only one
standard is involved” (in Mackay 1943: 236).

Interestingly, the (very few) exceptional and abberrant weight units Hemmy
discusses (in Marshall 1931, and Hemmy 1938) are not in the vicinity of the Mohenjo-
daro u over 240g. (From Chanhujo-daro there is one unfinished piece of circa 390 g;
Mackay 1943.) When fifteen odd specimens from Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, and
Chanhujo-daro were considered together, the binary system seemed paralleled by a
series of 1/3-fractions. “ The limited number of fractional weights leads one to suppose
that they had only a special use, and that like our Troy weight, they were used in
weighing gold, silver, and precious stones.” (A.R. Hall in Mackay 1943; 244.) Also
Mainkar finds his proposed two decimal series to be related to each other by a
proportion of 1/3 (though he does not refer to Mackay’s 1943- volume).

Hemmy’s approach is very sound, and he comments on other authors who have
compared single tokens or types with single units in other cultures, the Egyptian and the
Mesopotamian (1938b; 674ff). There is always a unit which is ‘quite near’ another unit.
This is not to deny that systems of weight units in one place might be designed to fit
foreign units, but only to say that individual types and tokens cannot be used to prove
such connections. Much the same problem plagues the attempts to align u and i to
weight of objects or of weight units: individual inscriptions might be fitted to ‘possible’,
but highly insecure, weight of a worn and corroded object. Likewise, individual
numerals may resemble numerals in other cultures: Mackay refers to the U-shaped 10
of the Egyptian numeral system (1938:454). But just as weight units normally form
systems, so may numerals do, and this fact is the basis on which the present study rests.

7. SUMMARY

The organization of the present paper was primarily according to objects. A
summary arranged according to type of argument is in place.

Series of simple strokes and ‘horse shoes’ on Indus metal ware suggest that an
additive, sign-value notation for indicating numbers was used. The present paper
established the numerical expressions on metal tools as a specific text genre and
indented nine such inscriptions. The questions addressed concerned what numerical
values the possible numerals were of and whether they related to the weight of the
inscribed objects.

Straightforward mathematical solutions are impossible because inscriptions and
objects are in a bad condition. Reference to consistency in form and arrangement of
numerals were made a few times to exclude some readings. Still, uncertainty of which

106 INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE

sign forms have been incised and also of which the original weights might have been
has made it necessary to compute several solutions. These solutions seem to suggest
that numerals did not relate to weight:

For two Kalibangan objects, solving a system of equations of the form “expr. =
weight” led to an awkward solution where the larger unit was not present on the heavier
object. Furthermore, the solutions obtained for these objects did not conform to
solutions obtained for two objects from Mohenjo-daro.

Likewise, attempts to match numerals with Indus weight units were not very
successful; again an indication that numerals did not relate to weight.

But most conclusive is the circumstance that the structure of the system of weight
units does not appear to match the structure of the system of numerals. While the system
of weight units apparently is binary for smal! weight, it consists of a doubling/halving
decimal system for the rest, and this decimal base is incompatible with the octal system
which the numerals apparently constitute. Hemmy (i.a. 1938) has discussed the weight
units. The present study gathered the following arguments that the numerals form an
octal system:

There are two basic numeric symbols on metal tools, ‘horse shoes’ and strokes, here
denoted by u andi respectively.

The number of occurrences ina single numerical expression of the lesser numerical
unit should, as a rule, give a lower limit for the higher unit. Up to eleven strokes have
been found in one single inscription. On three objects (including the one with eleven
strokes), some strokes form a tilted row. Such strokes have here been denoted by at.
Their odd appearance indicates that t #i and speaks against the duodecimal interpretation
otherwise suggested by the inscription with eleven strokes.

In fact, there are no more than seven iin any inscription, which suggests a relation
by eight between the two magnitudes denoted by u and i, and there are also never more
than seven u which again supports the octal interpretation. Similar observations have
been made by Fairservis (1992) with respect to the whole of the Indus texts corpus.
Here, the corpus was purposefully delimited not to conflate texts that might have been
written by different standards.

The number of t-strokes are four in all three cases where tilted rows appear. This
fact was here taken to indicate that i represented eight t, because the simple stroke i
probably represented a frequently employed magnitude, and in any system, half of such
a magnitude could be a rather frequent magnitude too, whence the appearance of 4t in
some inscriptions. but it was also noted that the 4t might be a non-numeral sign. In either
case though, i and t should not be conflated.

By internal evidence, then number of times a numeral can occur in sequence
appears to be bound by eight. That is, if the different numerals together formed a
system, as supposed here, that system was octal. This is an interesting fact in itself, but

INDUS NUMERALS ON METAL TOOLS 107

unfortunately, it demolishes the hypothesis that the numerals represent weight units, at
least the commonunits described by Hemmy (1938). The mathematical treatment of the
numerical expressions when these were inserted into weight equations furthermore
speaks against any relation to weight, although no conclusive results can be reached
with only a few objects per site, since any marks of weight or any weight units for metal
could have been off local and fortuitous design.

To definitely refute or revive the hypothesis that numerals relate o weight, more
objects to test the hypothesis on are needed. Another way to solve the puzzle would be
that weight units inscribed with numerals were found. As itis, it is instead tempting to
take the absence of numerals on weight units as indicative: numerals were not used
together with any system of weight units.

The non-preservation of records and the exclusively religious design of the
preserved texts make it difficult to trace the growth of scientific ideas in
ancient India. Still the Indus Valley excavations show some acquaintance
with geometry. In the period between the eighth and fifth centuries B.c.
the Sulbastitras enunciate the Pythagorean theorem in general terms, use it
for constructing squares, rectangles, triangles and trapezia and for evaluating
surds, Many rational and irrational solutions of the right triangle and two
general solutions occur, A clear grasp of the relationship between length
and area and of the abstract idea of multiplication is noteworthy.

The period from the fifth century z.c. to the fifth century A.D. is more or
less dark since no mathematical records except the Bakshali manuscript
belonging to this period are preserved. The early Jaina canonical works
and Pingala’s Chandahsttras belonging to this period are familiar with series
mathematics. combinations, cirele geometry and computations of the areas of
simple geometrical figures. Minute calculations with large numbers imply
the use of decimal place value and zero in the pre-Christian centuries and the
opening centuries of the Christian era. By the time of Aryabhata I (fifth
century a.D.) mathematics including mensuration, equations, indeterminate
analysis, series and sine-chords forms part of astronomy. Brahmagupta
(seventh century a.p.) made significant advances in the geometry of cyclic
figures, which was advanced still further by Narayana in the fourteenth
century. Before the time of Bhaskara II, the volume and surface area of
spheres are correctly known and derived and indeterminate analysis, too, has
advanced further. Madhava in the fourteenth century discovered integra-
tion by summation of series and with its help discovered infinite series
for a, the arc of a circle and the sine and cosine chords of ares. The
geometrical bias of Sulbasiitra mathematics was preserved and improved
upon by the later Aryabhata school.

The growth of scientific ideas in India is very difficult to trace chiefly
because of the undue importance that Indians attached to religion and philo-
sophy and secondly because the Indian climate does not permit the long
preservation of records. The Vedas, the only records of India’s ancient
civilization, preclude by their very nature, science and mathematics from their
purview. The scanty remnants dug up at Mohenjo-daro, Harappa and other
places in the Sindhu Valley have exploded the once widely held view that the
Indians acquired the art of writing very late. But the excavated engravings
have not yet been satisfactorily deciphered (Rev. Heras has made a beginning).
Even with these handicaps we are in a position to assert that the Indus
Valley people had some idea of geometry. They seem to have had

VOL. 4, Nos. 1 & 2,

well-planned towns, which necessitate some knowledge of geometry. Again
many of the designs on their pottery are geometrical, groups of semi-circles
and triangles, a series of intersecting circles, a rectangle with the four sides
incurved, ete.

The Vedic Aryans attached the greatest importance to sacrifices. Since
the correct orientation and measurements of the altars (vedis) and fire-places
(agnis) were supposed to ensure their effectiveness, the science of geometry and
arithmetic grew up to make this correctness possible. This knowledge is
codified in the Sulbasatras which form part of the Kalpasitras. But there is
no doubt the knowledge itself is much more ancient than the Sulbasiitras
(eighth to fifth centuries B.c, according to Western scholars). The Krsna
Yajurveda and the Satapatha Brahmana mention 36 and 15 as the sides of
aright triangle. The Satapatha Brahmana speaks about increasing the size of
the Mahavedi fourteenfold which has to be done, as the Sulbastitras show, with
the help of the theorem of the square of the diagonal. But to the authors of
the Sulbasatras belongs the credit of enunciating this theorem (Pythagoras
theorem) in general terms for the first time. Only the altar-building priests
being more interested in squares and rectangles speak of the sides and diagonal
of a rectangle and square instead of the sides and hypotenuse of a right
triangle. The geometrical constructions employed in the Sulbasitras include
the construction of perpendiculars, perpendicular bisectors, rectangles, tra-
pezia and isosceles triangles and circles equal in area to a given square and
vice versa, a square with area equal to any multiple of that of a given square,
transformation of a rhombus into an equivalent rectangle, finding a square
equal in area to the sum of the areas of any number of squares, etc.

These constructions imply a considerable amount of geometrical knowl-
edge. The widest use is, of course, of the theorem of the square of the diagonal
and its converse. The converse, that is three side-lengths connected by the
relationship 2*-+-y? = 2? will produce a right-angled triangle, is used again and
again. A good number of such side-sets, integral, rational but not integral,
and non-rationals determined approximately are enumerated

Also 4/2, V3, +/4, in fact the value of any surd or square root, is evaluated by
the Sulbasitrakaras geometrically with the help of the theorem of the square of
the diagonal. This means that the full significance of the theorem was grasped
by the Sulbasatrakdras. Theirs was not a casual acquaintance with a few
right triangles like the one with 3, 4, 5 with which most ancient nations seem
to be familiar.

The Sulbasitrakaras were acquainted with the fundamental property of
similar figures (or at least similar right triangles) that their corresponding
elements are proportional. The squaring of the circle, the age-old problem of
mathematics, is also attempted, though not with conspicuous success.

The concept of area and its relationship with length was fully grasped.
That the area of a triangle (it is the isosceles triangle which is discussed) is
half the area of a rectangle on the same base and with the same altitude;
that the diagonal of a rectangle divides it into two equal areas; that the two
diagonals together divide it into four equal parts, pairs of opposite parts being
identically equal; that the figure got by joining the middle points of the
adjacent sides of a square is a square with half the area of the original square
—all this is known. What is more remarkable is the realization that fraction
of a unit of length will produce a fractional unit of area which is numerically
much less than that of the length. Arithmetically this means that the authors
of the Sulbasdtras realized that multiplication can give a product less than the
multiplicands, ie. they had gone beyond the concrete fact of multiplication
and reached the abstract idea. This early realization is the precursor of all
the advance that Indians made in algebra and arithmetic in the early centuries
of the Christian era.

The way in which the Sulbasdtrakaras viewed the side of a square had far-
reaching significance. The side is the karayi, the maker of the area of the
square. This concept of the square root of any number enabled them to

evaluate surds with wonderfully close approximations,
5 ,.1,1 1
aE area!

According to Thibaut this result could have been obtained geometrically
after arriving empirically at the result 122+122—=172-1, Or, did the

62 T, A, SARASWATHL

Sulbasitra mathematicians possess the approximation formula for the evalua-
tion of a surd, namely «4 =a + x (where a2 is the perfect square nearest

to A and r = A—a?). Nilakantha (fifteenth century)! thinks that they
began with a square of side 12 and qyaluated 4/288 using this approximation
formula. Rodet is of opinion that the Sulbasitra authors knew some process of
high order approximation to the value of a surd. Considering the compu-
tational skill acquired by them by the study of squares with integral and
fractional sides, their acquaintance with the identity (a+b)? = a?+2ab+b?
and the approximation formula based on it is not improbable. What Thibaut
and Nilakantha fail to explain is the splitting up of 17 into Bette.
Dr. B. B. Datta’s mode of derivation furnishes this explanation. The
irrationality of 4/2 and most probably of many other surds was recognized by
the authors of the Sulbasitras.

The preoccupation with the right triangle led to progress in other
branches of mathematics too. A number of sets of Pythagorean numbers
(ie. numbers satisfying the relationship x%--y? = z*) were discovered and
trying to divide the cord of given length into parts capable of yielding
various right triangles the Sulbasitrakaras arrived at a general solution in
rational numbers, namely 2n(n-+1), 2n+1, 2n(n+1)+1. This was Pytha-
goras’ general solution according to Dickson.2 But Dickson was not aware
that the Sulbasitras had any general solution. Katyayana’s method for
combining any nuinber of equal squares into a big square gives another

general solution’
m?—1 nett
Me —o > —y .

The solution of other simultaneous indeterminate equations with four or
more unknowns is involved in finding the area and numbers of the different
bricks to be employed in paving the layers of the agnis (fire-places). Thus the
first beginnings of indeterminate analysis whose bloom we see for the first
time in Aryabhata I are noticeable in the Sulbasiitras.

The simple algebraical identities

(a--b)? = u®+2ab+b2

(a—b)? = a®@—2ab-+-b?
deducible from geometrical addition and subtraction of squares must also have
been familiar.

From the Sulbusitra period, i.e. fifth to eighth centuries 8.0. to the period
of Aryabhata I and the Saryasiddhante (i.e. fourth to sixth centuries), there is a
hiatus in our knowledge of the development of mathematies and astronomy in
India. The records, if any were scientifically composed, are irretrievably


DEVELOPMENT OF MATHEMATICAL IDEAS IN INDIA 63

lost. Only the isolated use of mathematics in Pingala’s Chandahsitra and
Jaina religious works show that the period was not entirely sterile. The
rudimentary computational formulae connected with the trapezium and
the circle occur in many Jaina works. The Séryaprajiapti (fifth century
B.C.) seems to distinguish between a caturasrah and a catuskonah which seems
to show that the Indians had the conception of angles and that the word
kona is of indigenous origin, not a borrowing from Greek gonon.

In circle geometry the correct formula for the circumference and area of a
circle is known, but the value of 7 accepted as exact is 4/10. The correct
expression for the chord in terms of the diameter of the circle and the height
of the are, ie. C = +/4h(d—h) derived with the help of the theorem of the
square on the hypotenuse, and approximate expressions for the arc, height
and chord in terms of one another, are found in the Tuttvdrthddhigamabhasya
of Umasvati (150 B.c.). From the formula for the chord, an expression
for the height of the arc, viz. h = 4(d—/d?—c2), is obtained and stated.
This entails the solution of the quadratic equation 4h(d—h) = c?. This
is the first recorded instance of the solution of a quadratic equation in
India.

The mensuration of the trapezium, a shape equally important in the Vedic
sacrificial lore and Jaina cosmography, is correctly done.

More important in the history of mathematics are the calculations with
big numbers carried forward to the minutest fractions by the Jaina canonical
works. In the Jambudvipaprajfapti (fifth century B.c.) the circumference of
the earth with a diameter of 100,000 yojanas is given as 316,227 yojanas 3
gavyitis 128 dhanus and a little over 134 avgulas. Since 7 is equated to 4/10,
this minute calculation implies that a good method for extracting square roots,
necessarily based on the decimal place value system, was at the service of
these Jaina computers. The irrationality of 1/10 is also recognized as that of
“/2 by the Sulbasatras. The earth, according to the Jainas, is divided into
seven parts (vargas) by mountain ranges, running parallel to the diameters of
the earth. When calculating the frontiers of these varsas from the formula
C = +/4h(d—h), square roots are in a similar way determined to a high
degree of approximation. The familiarity with the decimal place value system
is further borne out by the enumeration of the names of numbers increasing by
multiples of 10. Very large numbers are thus named. ‘the Buddhist work,
Lalitavistira of the first century B.c., gives the names of numbers up to 1053,
The decimal place value system together with zero must have been in wide use
in India by this period. The earliest recorded use of the zero is in Pingala’s
Chandahsitra (stitras 29 and 30).

The use of such large numbers led the Jainas to a conception of infinity.
They recognize many kinds of infinity.

64 T. A, SARASWATHI

Another noteworthy feature in the Jaina mathematics of this pre-
Christian period is the acquaintance with the powers of numbers and the laws
of indices. The Uttarddhyayana Sitra (300 B.c.) speaks of varga (square),
ghana (cube), varga-varga (fourth power), ghana-varga (sixth power), ghana-
varga-varga (twelfth power) and the Anuyogadvdrasitra (first century B.C.)
speaks of first square, second square, first square root, second square root,
etc. The latter also notes that the first square root multiplied by the second
square root is the cube of the second square root, and the second square root
multiplied by the third square root is the cube of the third square root,
or

and
a ak = (a8)8
Also that the number got by multiplying the fifth square of 2 by its sixth
square is a number which can be divided by two 96 times, i.e.

The Anuyogadvara satra knows, we have to conclude from all this, that
am a = amtn and (a™)” = an, One feature we notice about the Jaina treat-
ment of numbers and indices is that they seem to have a special liking for 2
and its multiples and submultiples. Indeed later Jaina texts like the Tri-
lokaséra (tenth century a.D.) of Nemicandra express numbers as powers of
2, these powers being termed ardhacheda. Multiplication or division of two
numbers means the addition or subtraction c! their ardhachedas. If a
number is to be raised to any power the ardhacheda of the number is to be
multiplied by the ardhacheda of the power. Nemicandra nearly develops a
logarithmic system with the base 2.

Permutations and combinations (termed vikalpa) was a favourite study
with the Jainas. The Bhagavati Sutra (300 B.c.) calculates the possible
number of combinations that can be got out of a given number of fundamental
philosophical categories taken one at a time, two at a time, three at a time or
more at a time (sdtra 314) and the groups that can be formed out of the sense
organs. Such calculations are also found in the Anuyogadvarasitra and the
Jambudvipaprajiiapti. Correct results are invariably obtained through calcula-
tions based on the formulae
Ney = n(n—1), uot —l)}
and i

_ P= n(n—1)...{n—(r—1)}.
Instances of permutations and combinations are found in Hindu works of
more or less the same period. Pingala’s Chandahsdtra, which cannot be later
than the second century B.c., deals with the arrangement of short and long
letters in metres. The Suéruta Samhité (earlier than Panini) notes correctly

DEVELOPMENT OF MATHEMATICAL IDEAS IN INDIA 65

that 63 combinations can be made out of the six rasas. Varahamihira’s (sixth
century A.D.) Brhatsamhita contains examples of both permutations and com-
binations. Even if the earlier instances have been worked out by actually
writing out the different groups (Prastara) Varihamihira who deals with
problems resulting in large numbers of combinations must have been in
possession of the general formula. This is stated for the first time by
Mahavira’ (G.S.8. VI 3364), Brahmagupta might have dealt with it, but
the Chandacityutturédhyaya of the Brdhmasphutu-siddhinta has defied all
attempts at elucidation till now and so nothing definite can be said. A
tenth-century commentator of Pingala’s Chandabsitra, Hemacandra, used a
triangle of numbers (Meruprastéra) to arrive at the values of nx, nCg, nz,
etc., easily. Small squares are to be drawn
as in the figure so as to form a triangle.
One is to be written down in the first square.
In the rest of the squares the sum of the
numbers in the two squares immediately
above them are to be written. Then the
rth row gives the values of Cy, r@g, 7703... .
vC, in order, This diagram is similar to
| Pascal’s Triangle, but much simpler. The

commentator himself is six centuries earlier
than Pascal, and he claims the rule is con-
tained in Pingala’s own sdtras. The sitra
in question,’ very concise and elliptical, cannot be understood without the
help of a commentary. Verse 22, ch. 77, of the Brhatsamnhita seems to
contain the same rule for forming the Meruprastara triaugle.

The first systematic treatment of combinations is by Mahavira. Bhas-
kara II deals with both combinations and permutations. But neither of
these mathematicians refer to Meruprastara. By the time of Bhaskara
permutations and combinations of digits in forming numbers seem to be
the chief interest, though the number of images of deities with different
combinations and permutations of characteristic weapons is dealt with.
This shift of interest must be responsible for the shift in the nomenclature.
What was vikalpa (sometimes bhatiga) to the Jainas aud Varahamihira
becomes Ankapasa in Bhaskara and Narayana Pandita. Narayana elaborates
a variety of Prastdras, but does not give Halayudha’s Meruprastdra.

By the end of the early Jaina period we get the Bakhshali manuscript
which bears witness to considerable development in algebra and arithmetic
during the second century a.D, and earlier. Fair advancement in the mani-
pulation of complex fractions and surds is seen. The approximation formula,

pressed into use. Moreover, an elaborate method for estimating the error in
the various orders of approximation is found employed. This is done with
respect to one problem only. But the idea itself does not seem to have
occurred to any nation before the Bakshali manuscript.

The problem in which this calculation of error is done is one in which
the period of an arithmetic progression is to be found from its sum and other
elements. The period is an irrational number. The author of the Bakshali
manuscript seems to have had a purely academic interest in series and set
himself diverse problems. Besides arithmetic progressions with fractional
and irrational periods and geometric progressions he has complex series like

ty 2b 3te+ dig + ...

(where ¢,, tg, tg... are the successive terms of the series) and
ty +(tyr-tdty) Hird (fe bar)} + itd tary...

The interest in series displayed by the Jaina religious aud semi-religious
works seems to have resulted in considerable development.

Some interesting problems leading to indeterminate equations are solved
by substitution, but a general method is not indicated. The method of false
position is also used.

Rudimentary symbolism is in evidence. For the negative sign a real
symbol, a cross, is used while for addition, ete., the abbreviations like 4 (47),
T (gunita), (milla), etc., are used. The zero is used as a symbol for the
unknown quantity. Special techniques for working out problems and for
writing out equations have also been developed. In the treatment of the
quadratic indeterminate equations ~/x+a = 8, «/x—b = the Bakshali
manuscript bears a close resemblance to the Brahmasphuta-siddhinta, while
in its treatment of series it is a link between early Jaina mathematics and
Mahavira.

By the time of Aryabhata I (a.p. 499) astronomy (and astrology) had
established itself as an important science and mathematics had come to be
looked upon as an accessory part of that science. The circle assumes paramount
importance in geometry and a new branch of mathematics, chord trigo-
nometry, comes into existence. The theory of epicycles to account for the
motions of the heavenly bodies is firmly rooted, whether it was of Greek
origin or of indigenous origin. But the great advance over Greek astronomy
was the use of the ardhajyd, half-chord or sine-chord, for calculations in the
circle. A fairly accurate table of 24 sine-chords along with the method of
constructing it is found both in the Aryabhafiya and in the Saryasiddhanta.
Aryabhata states and uses a remarkably good approximation for 7 and still
recognizes it as approximate only. A method of interpolation based on
proportion is also used.

DEVELOPMENT OF MATHEMATICAL IDEAS IN INDIA 67

Jt must have been the needs of astronomical calculations which led to
the spectacular bloom in indeterminate analysis found in the Aryabhatiya.
In the Sulbasdtras and the Bakshali manuscript we do find sporadic
instances of indeterminate equations. But a general form ax—by = C and a
general method for solving it in positive integers is found for the first time in
the history of mathematics in Aryabhata’s work. Improvements in the
method were effected by later mathematicians.

Brahmagupta (A.D. 628) extended indeterminate analysis to equations
of the second degree of the form Na?+1 = y? (vargaprakrti). The solution
which does not involve the use of continued fractions is much simpler than
that given by Lagrange in 1767 and is ingenious. Bhaskara II (1150) im-
proved upon this and discovered his cyclic (Cakravéla) method for solving
Na®+k = y®. Many other indeterminate equations are cleverly reduced to
this form and solved.® It is for the treatment of vargaprakrti that Bhaskara
deserves a place in the history of mathematics.

By the time of Aryabhata other branches of algebra and arithmetic also
must have attained considerable progress. Love for and skill in computations
the Indians possessed from the time of the Sulbasitras (witness the accurate
calculations of area in the construction of the fire-places) and the early religious
texts of the Jainas (witness their calculations of the areas, etc., of the dvipas
and varsas). The need for elaborate calculations led to the perfection of the
arithmetical operations. The methods perfected for multiplication and divi-
sion of large numbers are given by Brahmagupta and later writers. The
method for finding the square root of large numbers was known to the early
Jaina works though Aryabhata 1 is the first to give an account of the process,
The method for finding the cube root also is given by Aryabhata, All these
methods are more or less the same as the modern methods, which are derived
from the Indian methods which reached Kurope via the Arabs.

The practical needs of everyday life were responsible for the rest of the
topics which form the stock-in-trade of texts on arithmetic from the time of
Aryabhata, or rather from that of the Bakshali manuscript. These are: Rule
of three, inverse rule of three, the rule of tive, of seven, of nine and of eleven;
barter and exchange and mixtures. Besides these series (sredhi), geometry of
plane figures, calculations connected with excavations or volumes (khata),
heaps (rdsi), piles (citi), sawing (krakacika) and shadows (chdy@) are included
in Patiganita or arithmetic. (This nomenclature is derived from the board
which was used to do calculations on). The operations witli fractions and
their simplification also form an important part of arithmetic.

After the Sulbasitra period geometry undergoes a fundamental change.
The circle is the centre now. Aryabhata has rules for calculating the area of
triangles and trapezia. Nothing more. The Pythagorean theorem is enun-
ciated in connection with the calculations with shadows, where all measure-

68 T. A. SARASWATHI

ments are made with respect to a circle of reference (svaurtta).1° In circle
geometry two important facts are stated, viz. (1) the chord of one-sixth the
circumference is equal to the radius of the circle, (2) the square of half the
chord of an arc is equal to the product of its own height and the height of the
remaining arc of the circle.

Aryabhata’s knowledge of volumes is rudimentary. The expressions he
gives for the volume of a sphere and the volume of a tetrahedron are both
wrong obviously because they are based on false analogy.

Brahmagupta deals with cyclic figures only though he does not expressly say
that his treatment is limited to these. But he has new discoveries to his credit.
He states that the area of a cyclic quadrilateral is +/(s—a)(s—b)(s—c)(s—d)
and that of a triangle is +/s(s—a)(s—6)(s—e) (where s is the semi-perimeter and
a, b, ¢, d are the sides) and that the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral are

(ab -+ed)(ac+bd)
ad+be
and
[See
abted .

These results now go by the name of Brahmagupta. Their derivations as given
by the author of the Yuktibhasa (sixteenth century) makes use of Ptolemy’s
theorem. Also Prthidakasvamin, Brahmagupta’s tenth-century commen-
tator, states and proves Ptolemy’s theorem. Brahmagupta produces the
flank sides of a quadrilateral to meet at a point. The triangle so formed is
called a guciksetra and calculations of its altitude and other elements have
been indulged in by Indian mathematicians down the ages up to Narayana of
the fourteenth century. Brahmagupta also shows how to construct a rational
eyclic quadrilateral with the help of rational right triangles and gives an
expression for the circumradius which will give the correct result only in
limited cases. But the expression he gives for the circumradius of the cyclic
trapezium is really of wider application and this is given by Mahavira as the
circumradius of the cyclic quadrilateral.

The next important development in the geometry of the cyclic quadri-
lateral is found in Narayana’s Ganitakawmudi (fourteenth century). His
important theorem is: Three and only three diagonals are possible for four
side-lengths of a cyclic quadrilateral. Also the area of a cyclic quadrilateral
is the product of these three diagonals divided by twice the circum-diameter.
Besides these, Narayana has many calculations connected with the cyclic
quadrilateral which are not found in earlier mathematical works. These
imply a knowledge of the theorems: (1) the angle in a semi-circle is a right
angle and (2) the angles in the same segment are equal.

DEVELOPMENT OF MATHEMATICAL IDEAS IN INDIA 69

To the Kerala astronomer-mathematicians of the later Aryabhata school
these are quite well known and in addition they derive many important
trigonometrical results with the help of the cyclic quadrilateral. One purely
geometrical new development is the discovery of the expression for the
circumradius in terms of the sides of a cyclic quadrilateral. Paramesvara
of the fifteenth century in his Lildvatibhdsya gives this new expression in
the verse:

arent ensaratazarat fart sary

DHRAATA FAHATTATAATT |

maayea agd fassrared fatray,

aq aaliaat aferatarafaeed 1
‘The three sums of the products of the sides taken two at a time are to be multiplied to-
gether and divided by the product of the sums of the sides taken three at a time and diminished

by the fourth. If a circle is drawn with the square root of this quantity as radius, the whole
quadrijateral will be situated inside it.’

That is, if @, b, ¢, d are the sides and r the circumradius,

_ J ~~ _(ab+ed)(ae+ bd) (ad -+be)
(a-b+e—d\(b+c+d—a)(e+d+a—b)\(d+a+b—c)

The Kriyakramakari, an anonymous commentary on the Lilavati composed
most probably in the sixteenth century, gives the rationale. The expression
according to Smith!) was discovered in Europe by Lhuiler in 1782.
Paramesvara and the other Kerala mathematicians understand clearly
the significance and limitations of Brahmagupta’s results about the cyclic
quadrilaterals which the mathematicians in between seem to have missed.
The Yuktibhasa (sixteenth century) proves the trigonometrical results

sin? 4— sin? B = sin (448) .sin (A—B)
and

with the help of the cyclic quadrilateral using geometrical analysis.l2 As
already stated the Yuktibhasd also derives Brahmagupta’s expressions for the
area and diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral and in the course of the process
proves Ptolemy’s theorem as well as Narayana’s theorem which states that
the area of a cyclic quadrilateral is the product of the three diagonals divided
by twice the cireum-diameter.4

Aryabhata barely gives the expression for the area of a triangle as half
the base multiplied by the altitude. Brahmagupta considers the triangle as
the limiting case of the quadrilateral and so makes the mean of the flank

70 T. A. SARASWATHI

sides multiplied by half the base the gross area of a triangle. And corre-
sponding to the expression +/(s—a)(s—b)(s—c)(s—d) for the area of a cyclic
quadrilateral +/s(s—a)(s—b)(s—c) is the exact area of a triangle. The altitude,

given in the form of a theorem connected with chords in the Yuktibhdsa and
proved (pp. 244-246). The theorem runs: The product of two contiguous
chords divided by the diameter is equal to the altitude dropped from the
meeting point of the chords on the line joining their ends. The proof is based
on the proportionality of the corresponding sides of similar triangles which,
though not dealt with separately in Indian mathematical works, forms along
with the theorem of the square on the hypotenuse the basis of all computations
in Indian geometry and trigonometry. Indeed Bhaskara {1 compares pro-
portion (trairdsikam) in its comprehensive role to the all-pervading Visnu.

Mahavira in the ninth century refers to the circle inscribed in triangles
(and quadrilaterals) giving a general formula for its radius, viz. in-radius
_ area
~~ half the perimeter *

We do not know how Mahavira managed to draw the circle since angles and
their bisectors seem to be unknown. Nor do we know whether he was aware
that the in-centre is on the bisectors of the angles. Aryabhata II (tenth
century) investigates the condition for the formation of closed figures but,
baffled by Brahmagupta’s results for the quadrilateral, cuts himself away
from cyclic figures altogether. In this he is followed by Bhaskara 11, Nara-
yana, on the other hand, stresses the cyclic character of the triangle giving a
new expression for the circumradius and one for its area involving the circum-
radius. The latter is area = product of sides of sides The Yuktibhast also says the

4. circumradius
sides of triangles are invariably chords (p. 231).

The Kerala mathematicians after the end of the thirteenth century give

logical proofs and demonstrations of many theorems. These are:

(1) The area of a triangle is equal to half the product of the base
and altitude. (The proof is an ingenious and convincing demon-
stration.)

(2) The product of the sides of a triangle divided by the circum-diameter
is the altitude on the base (Y.B., p. 231).

(3) The perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle are concurrent.
(This is proved for the equilateral triangle (under Aryabhatiya
Ganitapada 6).)

DEVELOPMENT OF MATHEMATICAL IDEAS IN INDIA 71

(4) The square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to
the sum of the squares on the other two sides. (A demonstrational
proof is given. A proof based on similar triangles and an alge-
braical proof were given by Bhaskara II in his Bijaganita in the
twelfth century.)

One field in which Indian mathematicians made notable advance is the
formation of rational figures or more broadly in the theory of numbers. Their
contribution to indeterminate analysis, unique in the ancient world, has
already been touched upon. Their exercises in the formation of rational
tight triangles is a direct descendant of the importance of such triangles in
the Sulbasitra constructions which at least in two cases imply familiarity with
general solutions of the rational right triangle almost at the same time when
Pythagoras was grappling with the same problem. We are not allowed to see
how the seedlings in the Sulbasitras grew and throve till their bloom in Brahma-
gupta’s time and later. For, of the only mathematical work of this period,
the Bakshali manuscripts, the geometrical parts have not been spared and in
the highly condensed Aryabhatiya the topic is left out with only a doubtful
passing reference. Brahmagupta like all his successors constructs rational
rectilinear figures by the juxtaposition of rational right triangles which are
honoured with the name of jdatyas. He gives rational solutions for (1)
isosceles triangle, (2) scalene triangle, (3) right triangle with one side about the
right angle given, (4) isosceles trapezium (the method being the same as that
indicated by Baudhayana fifteen centuries earlier,14 (5) a trapezium with three
sides equal and (6) a cyclic quadrilateral. Mahavira treats rational figures
elaborately and systematically making clear the method of forming them.
Narayana’s treatment is still more elaborate. The later Aryabhata school does
not devote its attention to rational figures except in commentaries. But in
the Kriyakramakari Bhaskara’s solution of the rational right triangle is linked
with chord geometry.

Aryabhata’s indeterminate analysis and other isolated topics no doubt
indicate that algebra was in a fairly advanced state by his time. A fuller
record is afforded by the mathematical chapters of the Braéhmasphufa-siddhanta.
The laws of signs, the fundamental operations with algebraical expressions and
with zero are fully understood. The quotient got by dividing any quantity by
zero is termed khahara and is recognized to be infinite. The laws of indices do
not get an equally clear and full treatment. But multiplication, division,
squaring, cubing, finding the square and cube roots of powers are dealt with.
This implies a knowledge of the laws of indices. And we have already seen
how early Jaina literature and Nemicandra of the tenth century show that these
were thoroughly grasped. Also though the regular mathematical and astrono-
mical texts do not deal with higher powers the Jainas did handle high powers

72 T. A. SARASWATHI

correctly. A technique of forming and writing down equations also is devel-
oped with the initial letters of ydvat tdévat and the names of colours like
kalaka, pilaka, ete., standing for the unkuown quantities. The square and
cube are indicated by the letters va (varga), gha (ghana) and the negative sign
is indicated by a dot. The terms are ordered in the descending order of the
powers of the terms and terms of the same denomination in the two sides of
the equation are put one above the other. The absolute term is always
given at the end. The method as Smith says, ‘in one respect was the best
that has ever been suggested’.15 The lack of signs for +, x, + is of course a
serious defect. Linear equations in one, two and more unknowns, quadratic
equation in one or two unknowns, equations involving products of two un-
knowns (bhavitu) and isolated examples of equations of higher powers occur.

In finding volumes the progress was slow and faltering. The authors of
the Sulbasitras who used to stipulate the height of and the number of layers
and the total number of bricks in the fire-places must not only have had a
correct conception of volume but also have been aware that the volume of a
regular solid with opposite faces parallel is the area of the base multiplied by
the height. The early Jaina canonical works must have had the knowledge
of the correct volume of a trapezoidal solid, a cylinder and a prism with right
triangular base. But the pyramid and the sphere must have been baffling.
Aryabhata I errs in computing the volumes of both, though he knows correctly
the number of shots in a pyramidal pile. Brahmagupta knows the volume of
a pyramid is 1/3 the volume of a prism with the same height and base. The
volume of a frustum is derived in a curious way by calculating the approxi-
mate volume first by taking the mean of the base and face and then by taking
the mean of the areas of the face and base and manipulating these two together.
But we do not know whether he had a scientific method of computing. One
and a half centuries later Mahavira arrives at the correct volume of a tetra-
hedron by a similar process of manipulating a curious expression for the approxi-
mate volume. Soon after Sridhara gives the correct formula for the frustum
of a cone, though = is equated to 4/10. The methods of derivation being
unknown, these results have been suspected to be of foreign inspiration. But
that the Indians had their own methods of derivation is proved by the deriva-
tion of the formula for the frustum of a cone detailed by Virasena, the eighth-
century commentator of the Jaina work, Satkhandégama.1* This is done by
cutting up the frustum into a cyclinder and triangular wedges which can be
paired off to give rectangular wedges and then joined together to yield rec-
tangular parallelopipeds with volumes decreasing gradually to infinitesimals,
These form a decreasing geometrical progression and so their sum is obtainable.
The interest of the Jainas in series mathematics paid dividends.

The sphere is mentioned for the first time by Aryabhata I. Brahmagupta
ignores it. Mahavira and Sridhara give approximate expressions for its

DEVELOPMENT OF MATHEMATICAL IDEAS IN INDIA 73

volume which seem to be based on the correct formula. Bhaskara II not
only gives the correct formula but also shows how to derive it by cutting up
the sphere into small pyramids with bases on the surface and apexes at the
centre.17_ For this calculation a knowledge of the surface area of the sphere is
required which also is arrived at correctly by cutting up the surface into
narrow circular strips which are then opened up to form trapezia. With the
help of the sine-table the areas of these are calculated and added up.18 For
both the volume and the surface Bhaskara used a crude form of integration.
The mathematicians of the later Aryabhata school in the fourteenth to six-
teenth centuries had a much better method of integration which they applied
to the problem of finding the volume and surface area of a sphere. They cut
up the sphere into circular laminae of infinitesimal thickness for the volume
and the surface into circular strips of infinitesimal breadth for its area.

This leads us to the little known but important achievement of the Indian
mathematicians—the discovery of integration by the summation of power
series and its applications. It was the astronomical need of knowing the
circumference, chords and arcs of a circle accurately that led to the perfection
of this tool. But behind the achievement lies the long and sustained interest
in series of the Indians. In the Taittiriya Samhita’® and in the Vdjasaneyt
Samhita2° we get number series in arithmetic progression and in the Pavica-
vimsa Brahmana the geometrical progressions 12, 24, 48, 96... 196608,
398216. In the Brhaddevatd the sum of the natural numbers from 2 to 1,000
is correctly given. The Jaina cosmography and accounts of hells and heavens
contain many instances of Arithmetic Progressions and Geometrical Pro-
gressions. In the context of the pronounced love of calculations of the Jainas
it is quite likely that the early progress in series mathematics is entirely due to
them. Later works like the Trilokasara and Gommatasadra enumerate many
different kinds of series (dhard). The commonly used word for series, Sredhi,
is etymologically obscure. May be it is a Prakritization of Sreni effected
by the Jainas from whom the word was reaccepted into Sanskrit.

Outside Jaina literature the Bakshali manuscript is quite at home with
series. Simple Arithmetical Progressions and Geometrical Progressions, even
complex series in the form of

Le y+ (tyr +dty) + {hard thy} 4 {hr tdi they}
2. +2 +b)4+-Blh +t) £44} 4 Matte tts) £(b+20}+ «
etc., are found in this fragmentary work.

Aryabhata I gives the sum of the natural numbers, of the triangular
numbers (samkalita-samkalita) and of the squares and cubes of the natural
numbers. We do not know how the last three were summed up. The later

Aryabhata school gives geometrical demonstrations for the results. Was the
mode of arriving at the results also geometrical ? Mahavira extends these


74 T. A. SARASWATHI

results to cover any series in Arithmetical Progression and also gives examples
of complex series reminiscent of Bakshali mathematics.

The first instance of the summation of a Geometrical Progression or
rather finding out the mth term (from which the sum of n—1 terms can be
easily found) is found in Pingala’s Chandahsitra in connection with finding
the number of metres of one letter, two letters, three letters, ete., in a line.
An easy method for finding the value of r” is given which is reproduced by
Mahavira centuries later.

_ It is Mahavira who for the first time gives a systematic treatment of
Geometrical Progressions. He knows that the sum of a Geometrical Progres-
arn
r=

“ and how

sion with a as first term, r as common ratio and n as period is

the formula is to be derived.2!_ In the Bakshali manuscript and the Ganita-
sdrasamgraha of Mahavira, arithmetical progressions with fractional periods
occur, in the former in isolated problems, but in the latter as a feature of a
regular topic ‘bhinnasamkalitam’ (summation of fractions). But geometrical
progressions with fractional periods are never found. Mahavira also sums up
arithmetico-geometrical series like

at(arkm)+(larkmyrim)+[(artm)rkmirtmy+ ...

His methods of splitting the number one into a regular series of unit fractions
is an exercise in geometrical progressions. Though the last named are con-
vergent series Mahavira does not seem to deal with an infinite convergent
series as Virasena earlier does in his derivation of the volume of a cone frus-
tum. Nilakantha (fifteenth century) also has recourse to the summation of
an infinite convergent series while deriving a good approximation formula for
the are a in terms of the chord ¢ and height h, viz. a = o/(I+)e +e.
The Indian mathematicians were aware latest by the ninth century that an
infinite convergent series has a finite sum. Nilakantha also gives a fine
logical explanation why this is so.22

Narayana (fourteenth century) takes a significant step forward in series
mathematics when he extends the samkalita-samkalita of Aryabhata I to
summation of any order. The sum of the first » natural numbers repeated r
times will be

n(n+1)(n+2)...(n+r—1)
Lr

By the end of the fourteenth century or earlier the summation of regular
series acquired a new meaning when it was applied to the summation of the
infinitesimally small parts of whole and thus became integration. This was
done for the first time by Madhava of Samgamagrama (fourteenth century) for
calculating the circumference of a circle from its radius. An infinite series
for or rather the circumference is obtained thus

In the course of its derivation many integrals of the powers of a quantity
and the results of repeated integration are proved and used. These are

From the series for z, by suitable manipulation many other infinite series for

The reasoning is the same as that for the series for the circumference. Simi-
larly with the help of the new found tool of integration and subtle reasoning
the infinite series for sin @ and cos 6 (actually R sin 8 and & cos 6) are derived23
which, since the Indian deals with the sine chords and cosine chords instead of
the ratios, take the form

The volume and surface area of a sphere are also correctly derived using the
same tool of integration. All this we know from the Yuktibhdsd (sixteenth
century), a mathematical treatise allegedly expounding the mathematics in
the Tantrasamgraha of Nilakantha Somayajin (fifteenth century) and an
anonymous and undated commentary on the Lilévati named Kriyakramakari,
written probably by Sankara Variyar, a pupil and commentator of Nilakantha.
The series for 7, the arc, and for the cosine and sine are found besides in the
Tantrasamgraha, the Karanapaddhati and the Sadratnamala. The latter two
are later than the Yuktibhdsd and the Kriyakramakari. The expository texts,
the Yuktibhasd and the Kriydkramakari, assign these results to Madhava of
Sangamagrima,

Integration by fluxions was discovered and used in India at least two
and a half centuries earlier than Newton and Leibnitz.

Another feature of Indian mathematics which attained its highest
growth in the later Aryabhata school is what can be termed geometrical
algebra. This is a direct inheritance from the Sulbasiitras which arrived
geometrically at the identities (a+b)? = a?+02+ 2ab and (a—b)? = a®-+-b2—2ab.
They also evaluated geometrically simple surds as well as those of the form
V@+e; 4/a2—F2. Throughout the ages geometrical demonstration must
have been used for validating algebraical truths though this being meant for the
edification of the direct pupils is usually left out of the texts. Bhaskara’s com-
mentators, Ganeéa and Krsna, give us a few examples of diagrammatic demon-
stration, namely those for a?—b2 = (a+b)(a—b) and (a-+-b)?—a?—b? = 2ah
and a geometrical method for solving the indeterminate equation

au-+by+e = wy.

Bhaskara I (seventh century) offers a geometrical explanation for }.3 -5
In the later Aryabhata school this method is ably and extensively used. The
Yuktibhasa®> explains the operations of multiplication and division diagram-
matically. The necessity for reducing fractions to a common denominator
before they are added or subtracted is also geometrically explained. The
identities

(a+b)? = a?-+-6?-+ 2ab

(a--b-++e)? = a®+b2-+- 2-4 2ab-+ 26c-++2ac

dab = (a--b)?—(a—b)?
are proved diagrammatically,

DEVELOPMENT OF MATHEMATICAL IDEAS IN INDIA vai

The Kriyakramakari elaborates a whole list of demonstrations for different
equalities and ascribes these to a mathematician, Citrabhanu. Examples are

a3 —b3—(a—b)8
3(a—5)

(1) =ab
a — 68 —(a—by3

Tab =a—h

(2)

and
2G b3) + (a—b)8
(3) ae =a-b.

More interesting is the graphical proof for the lemma in the Lildvati that
a?462—1 will be a perfect square if a = 8p4-+1 and b == 8p3 (where p is any
arbitrary number). The expressions for the sums of arithmetic and geometric
progressions are also diagrammatically validated. The practice of representing
arithmetic progressions diagrammatically is old. Sridhara (tenth century) and
Narayana (fourteenth century) represent Arithmetical Progressions by trapezia
while the later Aryabhata school represents them by a pile of as many rec-
tangular strips as there are terms in the series. The Kriyakramakari de-
monstrates by two-dimensional and three-dimensional representations the
truth of the expressions for (1) the sum of the natural numbers, (2) the sum
of the triangular numbers, (3) the sum of the squares of the natural numbers
and (4) the sum of the cubes of the natural numbers. These methods of
demonstration have the merit of being immediately convincing and can be
used with profit in schools. According to the Kriyakramakari the formulae
for the sums of the higher orders of triangular numbers can also be demon-
strated similarly. Did the mathematicians of these days have the conception
of spaces with more than three dimensions? We do not know.

After the middle of the sixteenth century no new ground seems to have
been covered. Even in the preceding centuries the torch was kept burning
only in India’s isolated corner strip, Kerala. This also was put out by the
wind of European incursions into the Malabar coast. Dazed by fire-arms and
dazzled by the enterprise and material advancement of the intruders, people
began to look down upon native scholarship and achievements and the pursuit
of mathematics died a natural death along with the other arts and sciences
of native origin.

This is a unique book which brings virtually 
direct experience of the masonry astronomical 
instruments of Jantar Mantar built by the 
illustrious Raja Sawai Jai Singh (1688-1743). 
While there are a couple of famous works on Raja 
Swai Jai Singh’s astronomical observatories, the 
uniqueness of the present book lies in including 
the 3-D “pop-up” illustrations of the astronomical 
masonry instruments of Jantar Mantars at Jaipur 
(Rajasthan) and Delhi.
Sawai Jai Singh-II, a highly trusted 
sāmanta(feudatory) of the Mughal emperor 
Mohammed Shah was the ruler of the Rajput state 
of Amber. Besides being an effective ruler, Jai 
Singh was a proficient astronomer and encouraged 
the pursuit of astronomy by inviting specialists 
in the field from Europe, Central Asia and India. 
He commissioned compilations of astronomical 
tables in Persian (Zīj-e-Muhammad Shahi, ZEM), 
Dk-paka-sārii (Sanskrit) etc.
He initiated constructions of five stone 
observatories – comprising huge instruments – 
in Delhi (1710), Ujjain (1729), Varanasi (1719), 
Jaipur (1719) and Mathura of which the last one 
is now extinct. The other four are still operational.
The popped-up models give an immediate 
understanding of the form and function of each 
instrument. The very first such model Sāmrā 
Yantra is a large sun-dial, comprising mainly a 
central gnomon (śanku) i.e. a vertical pole and 
a calibrated scale. As the shadow of the gnomon 
moves crossing the scale, the time during daytime 
can be reckoned.
Dakiottara Bhitti,  an instrument to 
mark the noon meridian passage of the Sun is a 
graduated semi-circle on the north-south wall. The 
pin at the centre casts its shadow on the graduated 
scale at the actual noon (meridian passage). The 
reading on the scale measures the maximum 
altitude (unnati). This in turn gives the sun’s 
declination (krānti); the north-south co-ordinate.
The north-south shift of the Sun enables one to 
fix the extreme north and south points, reached 
by the Sun, heralding the dakināyana (southern 
course) and the uttarāyana (northern course). 
These correspond respectively to the summer and 
winter solstices, taking place around June 22 and 
December 22 currently. This simple instrument 
was used to measure the obliquity of the ecliptic 
(with the celestial equator) also. The authors point 
out that in 1729 CE, it was measured to be 23o 28′ 
and that Hipparchus gave its value as 23o 51′ for his 
time (2nd century BCE). The instrument at Ujjain 
is the biggest (radius 6.17 metres) as compared to 
those at Jaipur, Varanasi and Delhi.
The aāmśa Yantra in Delhi enables 
determination of the north-south motion of the 
Sun. It is a small chamber in the eastern side with 
a pin-hole in the ceiling. The floor has a circular 
arc with a pin-hole in the ceiling. The floor has aBook Review: Jantar Mantar observatories 
229
circular arc with calibrated sixty degrees of angle. 
The Sun reaches the extreme north and south 
points respectively at the summer and winter 
solstices, around June 22 and December 22. The 
image of the pin-hole moves along the graduated 
arc at noon. This device fixes the solstices, useful 
in the preparation of calendar based on actual 
observations.
Nāi Valaya is a device to mark the passage 
of the Sun across the celestial equator (viuvat 
vtta). It is well known that the durations of the 
day and night are equal on the two equinoctial 
days around March 21 and September 23. The 
points of the Sun on the ecliptic (krānti vtta) on 
these two days are referred to as vernal equinox 
(vasanta viuva) and autumnal equinox (arat 
viuva) respectively. These are the points where 
the ecliptic cuts the celestial equator.
Cakra Yantra is a circular ring mounted on 
an axis parallel to the axis of the earth’s rotation. 
Another rod is placed perpendicular to the axis 
of rotation. The circle and the central rod are 
calibrated. A sighting tube is attached at the centre 
to align with a celestial body to be observed. The 
graduated marks on the instrument provide the 
north-south coordinates. The time (in hours) to 
reach the meridian is the other coordinate. This 
can be read out from a circular disc fixed at the 
base of the axis of rotation. The instrument is seen 
at Jaipur and Varanasi.
The other instruments of importance at 
the Jantar Mantars are (1) Jaiprakāśa Yantra and 
Kapāla Yantra, (2) Unnatāmśa Yantra, (3)Miśra 
Yantra, (4) Krānti Vtta (Ecliptic), (5) Śaku 
Yantra and (6) Yantrarāja (Astrolabe).
A small ring is pivoted at the centre of 
a hemispherical bowl which represents the sky. 
Its shadow inside the bowl reads out the altitude 
and azimuth. This information is passed on to 
another instrument called Kapāla Yantra to yield 
the celestial coordinates of the Sun.
Jaiprakāśa Yantra is a similar, but more 
sophisticated instrument. This comprises two 
complimentary bowls. There are six calibrated 
marble slabs in each of them. During the day the 
shadow of the central ring gives the altitude and 
azimuth. During the night, through a sighting tube 
the coordinates of any visible heavenly body can 
be obtained.
Unnatāmśa Yantra is a simple device for 
measuring the altitude (the angle above the horizon) 
of a heavenly body. For the altitude of stars and 
planets a sighting tube is also provided.
Miśra Yantra is a special instrument 
consisting of a gnomon (śanku) at the centre 
and four dials, with different orientations, above 
which the shadow of the gnomon can be read 
out. The eastern and western walls are graduated 
for a sundial – Samrāt Yantra. Its northern wall 
is purposely inclined – not vertical – so that the 
shadow of the gnomon (by the Sun) can be read 
on the dial called Karkarāśi Valaya only on the 
summer solstice day (June 22). 
The four central dials put together is 
called Niyat Cakra. The different planes of these 
dials enable one to get the local times at places of 
four different longitudes. It is found that the two 
dials on the west correspond to the longitudes 
of Zurich and Greenwich  while the two on 
the east correspond to Notkey in Japan and the 
island Serichew in Pacific Ocean. It is noted 
by the authors that the identifications are done 
only recently and not at the time of Jai Singh. 
The Dakiottara (south-north) Bhitti, explained 
earlier, is on the eastern wall while the Karkarāśi 
Valaya is on the northern wall.
Miśra Yantra also has an additional 
structure called  Agra Yantra in the north-west. The 
authors point out that its function is not known. 
But they guess that it may be meant to read time 
specifically on the day of the winter solstice 
(December 22). A clear schematic diagram of this 
structure is provided in page 18 of the book.230 
Indian Journal of History of Science
Krānti Vtta (ecliptic) is a relatively new 
instrument installed in 1902 as a replacement for 
the original one. It is used to estimate the positions 
of the Moon and the planets with reference to the 
ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun round the 
earth. It provides a scale inclined to the equator 
at 23o 27′ so that the coordinates measured along 
the equator are converted to the ecliptic ones, 
the celestial longitude and latitude. Two sighting 
tubes are also provided for viewing the heavenly 
bodies.
Śanku Yantra (gnomon) is a simple vertical 
stick mounted perpendicular to a graduated circle 
to read the Azimuth. The length of the shadow can 
be used to estimate the Altitude. This instrument 
is seen only in Ujjain.
Yantra Rāja (astrolabe) is an instrument 
used in the past by navigators to measure the 
local time, sidereal time, latitude and the time in 
the night. At Jantar Mantar there are two huge 
circular brass discs. The instrument has a plate 
which has the projections of stars onto a plate. 
The astrolabe has only the plate as a fixed dial 
and all the other parts namely Rule, Rete and 
Alidade – the calibrated scale, the star indicator 
and the sighting tube – are movable. In the case 
of the Sun the shadow alignment suffices to read 
out the altitude. The circle called ‘Rete’ has some 
bright stars marked. It can be moved on the dial to 
read out the azimuth corresponding to the altitude. 
The plate has equal azimuth and equal altitude 
circles drawn for a given latitude (of a place). 
During the day time the Sun’s position can be 
adjusted with the help of the ecliptic scale. The 
scale called ‘rule’ can be moved to read the times 
of sunrise and sunset. The same can be done in the 
case of stars with the help of ‘rete’. All these are 
clearly explained in a diagram for the astrolabe for 
Bengaluru (latitude =13′ N approximately).
On the whole this book is truly a boon for 
students as well as interested general readers. In the 
process of appreciating the instruments of Jantar 
Mantar, the reader learns practical observational 
astronomy. The advantage of the bilingual 
presentation is that the Kannaa knowing readers 
will understand the astronomical concepts and 
the functioning of the instruments (through ‘pop-
up’ images) better. Further, the readers become 
familiar with Indian equivalents, of technical 
terms in astronomy like krānti (declination), śara 
or vikepa (latitude of a heavenly body), krānti 
vtta (ecliptic), viuvat vtta (celestial equator), 
khamadhya (zenith) etc.

Abstract
Syamadas Mukhopadhyay of the Pure Mathematics Department of Calcutta University made 
important research work in various branches of Geometry. His famous theorem, eponymously called 
“Mukhopadhyay’s Four Vertex Theorem” is a notable piece of research and acted as a catalyst for further 
investigations in that area. Mukhopadhyay’s research works have created wide interest amongst researchers 
in Topology and Algebraic Geometry the world over. This article is both a tribute to the great geometer of 
India, as well as an effort to bring to the fore the price-less research contributions that he made, working 
in India under colonial rule. 
Key words: Cyclic points, Differential geometry, Hyperbolic geometry, Osculating conics,  
Sextactic points.

1. Childhood and Early Education
Syamadas    Mukhopadhyay    (SD 
Mukhopadhyay) was born at Haripal in the 
Hooghly district of West Bengal on the 22nd 
June, 1866. His father Babu Ganga Kanta 
Mukhopadhyay was in the state judicial service and 
was transferred to different places in connection 
with his official duties. As a consequence 
Syamadas studied in different institutions at 
different times. He completed his graduation from 
Hooghly College and obtained his M. A. degree 
in Mathematics from the Presidency College, 
Calcutta in 1890. In 1909 he won the Griffith’s 
Prize of Calcutta University for his mathematical 
dissertation entitled “On the infinitesimal analysis 
of an arc”. In 1910 he was awarded the Ph. D. 
degree by the University of Calcutta for his 
original work in Differential Geometry. His 
thesis was entitled “Parametric Coefficients in 
Differential Geometry of Curves”. It may be 
noted that S D Mukhopadhyay was the first Indian 
to obtain a doctorate degree in Mathematics in 
India. It is needless to mention that he was the 
first recipient of the Ph. D. degree in Mathematics 
from the Calcutta University.

2. Teaching Career
Soon after completing his M.A. in 
Mathematics, Syamadas Mukhopadhyay joined 
a private college in Calcutta as a faculty member 
and served there for several years. Thereafter 
he got an appointment in Government Service 
as a Professor of Mathematics in the Bethune 
College, Calcutta. In Bethune College, which 
happened to be the first women’s College in Asia, 
S D Mukhopadhyay had to undertake very heavy 
teaching load. There apart from Mathematics, 
he had to regularly take classes on English and 
Philosophy. In 1904, he was transferred to the 
Presidency College. He served there for eight 
years till 1912. In 1912, the then Vice-Chancellor 
of Calcutta University, Sir Asutosh Mookerjee, 
invited Syamadas Mukhopadhyay to join the 
newly set up Department of Pure Mathematics 
in the Calcutta University. S D Mukhopadhyay 
accepted the offer and joined the department. He 
served the department to the satisfaction of Sir 
Asutosh and worked there till 1932. During the last 
six years of his tenure, Syamadas held the post of 
a university professor of the Calcutta University. 
S D Mukhopadhyay was a talented teacher 
and his fame as a teacher of eminence spread far 
and wide. R C Bose after completing his M.Sc. in 
Applied Mathematics from the Delhi University 
came and joined the Pure Mathematics Department 
of Calcutta University as a student, just in order to 
be taught by Syamadas Mukhopadhyay. He later 
became a researcher under S D Mukhopadhyay 
and earned eminence as a great mathematician. 
Amongst many students who were taught by 
Syamadas Mukhopadhyay, three deserve special 
mention. They were G Bhar, who was a Professor 
of Mathematics in the Presidency College, Calcutta 
and a teacher of great repute, R N Sen, who became 
the Hardinge Professor of Pure Mathematics in 
Calcutta University and also a famed researcher in 
the field of Differential Geometry, and Professor M 
C Chaki who held the Chair  named “Sir Asutosh 
Birth Centenary Professor of Higher Mathematics” 
in Calcutta University and also did good research 
in many areas of geometry. 
3. Academic Career and Research 
Contributions
Syamadas Mukhopadhyay was possibly 
inspired during his undergraduate student days in 
Hooghly College by his teacher William Booth 
who was quite well known for his researches in 
geometry. He was the man who had influenced 
young Asutosh Mookerjee during the latter’s 
student days in the Presidency College. M C Chaki, 
a famed mathematician of Calcutta University  in 
his article on Syamadas Mukhopadhyay, wrote 
that “In a very short time after taking his B. 
A. degree he (S D Mukhopadhyay) solved an 
intricate geometrical problem, a fact recorded 
in M’celland’s ‘Geometry of the Circle’.” He 
has further written that S D Mukhopadhyay’s 
research contributions “were outstanding for their 
originality and novelty of treatment”.
Syamadas Mukhopadhyay’s research work 
may be broadly classified into Use of Synthetic 
Geometry to solve properties of plane curves; 
Non-Euclidean Geometry; Differential Geometry 
and Stereoscopic representations of 4-dimensional 
space.
In the first part, he has dealt with properties 
of plane curves, especially in their infinitesimal 
regions using synthetic methods. Here he has 
developed new methods. These methods led to a 
number of interesting theorems on the existence 
of minimum number of cyclic and sextactic points 
between two points of a given curve on a convex 
oval etc. In this context two of his theorems 
deserve special attention. But before that it would 
be necessary to understand what are cyclic and 
sextactic points. A cyclic point is a singular point, 
on a plane curve, where the circle of curvature 
passes through 4 consecutive points instead of 3. 
On the other hand a sextactic point is a singular 
point, where the osculating conic passes through222 
Indian Journal of History of Science
6 consecutive points instead of 5. At a cyclic 
point, the circle of curvature may touch the given 
circle internally or externally. In the former case, 
the point will be called in-cyclic and in the latter 
case, ex-cyclic. Similarly at a sextactic point, 
the osculating conic may touch the given curve 
internally or externally. In the former case, the 
point is called in-sextactic and in the latter case 
it is called ex-sextactic. With these definitions, 
S D Mukhopadhyay first demonstrated a number 
of interesting propositions. Later they led to his 
famous two theorems, which have already been 
mentioned above. Now they are being stated 
below.
Theorem I  states that “the minimum 
number of cyclic points on a convex oval is 4” and 
Theorem II   states that “the minimum number of 
sextactic points on a convex oval is 6”. These two 
theorems were first published in 1909 in the Bulletin 
of the Calcutta Mathematical Society (BCMS). 
But initially, at that time not much attention was 
paid to this piece of research. Only the eminent 
French mathematician J S Hadamard (1865-1963) 
referred to this work in the memoirs of College de 
France. However, much later, these theorems were 
re-discovered in Europe. Since then many noted 
mathematicians have taken them up as subject 
of investigations.  W Blaschke, a noted German 
geometer gave credit to Syamadas Mukhopadhyay 
for giving the original first proof of the Theorem 
I stated above. In modern literature of Geometry, 
this theorem is now eponymously quoted as 
“Mukhopadhyay’s Four Vertex Theorem”.  This 
celebrated theorem is stated in various important 
mathematical treatises such as Differential 
Geometry by H Guggenheimer, McGraw Hill, 
New York, 1930; Differential Geometry by J J 
Stoker, Wiley Interscience, 1969 and Elements of 
Differential Geometry by R S Millman and G D 
Parker, Prentice-Hall, Englewoods Cliffs, 1977.
As already mentioned, W Blaschke gave 
the credit of proving the “Four Vertex Theorem” 
to Syamadas Mukhopadhyay. He has mentioned 
this in his book “Vorlesungen uber Differential 
Geometry”, Springer, Berlin, 1924. Further 
references connected to this theorem are also given 
there. Later on S D Mukhopadhyay generalized 
these two theorems. The generalized Theorem I 
states that “If a circle C intersects an oval V in 
2n points (n 2) then there exists at least 2n cyclic 
points in order on V, of alternately contrary  signs, 
provided the oval has continuity of order 3”. The 
generalized Theorem II states that “If a conic C 
intersects an oval V in 2n points (n> or = 2), then 
there exist at least 2n sextactic points in order on 
V, which are alternatively positive and negative, 
provided V has continuity of order 5”. Thus S D 
Mukhopadhyay placed his earlier investigations 
on more rigorous basis. 
Apart from these investigations, Syamadas 
Mukhopadhyay published a number of research 
papers on the general theory of osculating 
conics. In this context, the comments made by 
his student G Bhar of Presidency College may 
be noted. Bhar wrote “It is highly probable that 
Mukhopadhyay was led to the study of the theory 
of osculating conics by Sir Asutosh’s work on 
the differential equations of all parabolas and 
his beautiful geometrical interpretation of the 
Mongean equation”.
In the second part of his research work, 
Syamadas Mukhopadhyay contributed to a type 
on Non-Euclidean geometry namely Hyperbolic 
Geometry. Actually hyperbolic geometry is the 
geometry obtained by assuming all the postulates 
of Euclid except the fifth one. The fifth postulate of 
Euclid is replaced by its negation. In the context of 
S D Mukhopadhyay’s research in Non-Euclidean 
geometry, the comments made by his student G 
Bhar, is very relevant. Bhar writes: 
“Professor Mukhopadhyay found himself in his 
elements when he was called upon to teach the 
principles of Non-Euclidean Geometry to the Post-
Graduate students of the University”. 
Serious research work in Non-Euclidean 
geometry in India was first undertaken by RHistorical Note: Syamadas Mukhopadhyay (1866-1937): A Reputed Geometrician 
223
Vaithyanathaswamy (1894-1960) of Madras 
University. His first two research papers1  in 
this field were published in the Journal of the 
Indian Mathematical Society (JIMS) in 1914. 
S D Mukhopadhyay in collaboration with his 
student G Bhar published his first research paper 
on hyperbolic geometry in the Bulletin of the 
Calcutta Mathematical Society in 1920. The paper 
was titled “Generalization of certain theorems in 
the hyperbolic geometry of the triangle”. This 
publication was followed by a number of research 
papers on this kind of geometry. The investigations 
carried out by him resulted in the important 
discovery of the “Rectangular Pentagon” and his 
beautiful geometrical interpretation of the Engel-
Napier rules. In collaboration with his two famous 
students R C Bose and G Bhar he made interesting 
generalizations of the ideas of concurrence and 
colinearity of lines and points in Non-Euclidean 
Geometry. To be more specific, S D Mukhopadhyay, 
extended the well known concurrency theorems 
of the angle bisectors and the right bisectors of 
the sides of an ordinary triangle, to all types of 
hyperbolic triads of lines and points. It may be 
noted that by a hyperbolic triad, it is meant a group 
of three elements (points or lines) lying upon a 
hyperbolic plane. In this context, his three research 
papers titled “Geometrical investigations on the 
correspondence between a right-angled triangle, a 
three-right-angled  quadrilateral and a rectangular 
pentagon in hyperbolic geometry” [BCMS, 13(4), 
(1922-1923):211-216];  “On general theorems of 
co-intimacy of symmetries and hyperbolic triad” 
[BCMS, 17(1), (1926): 39-55] and (with R C 
Bose) “Triadic equations in hyperbolic geometry” 
[BCMS, 18, (1927), 99-110] deserve special 
attention.
In the first paper mentioned above, 
S D Mukhopadhyay concluded “We have 
thus the closed series of 5 associated right-
angled triangles and the Engle-Napier Rules are 
shown to possess a real geometrical basis in the 
rectangular pentagon”. It was an exquisite piece 
of mathematical research.
In the third part of his research and 
investigations, Professor Syamadas Mukhopadhyay 
while dealing with Differential Geometry of curves, 
introduced for n-dimensional space curves certain 
differential forms. He named them parametric 
coefficients and using them he expressed many 
invariant properties of the curves. In this matter, 
another eminent geometer M C Chaki has 
commented “The distinct merit of the method of 
parametric coefficients of Mukhopadhyay lies in 
the fact that it achieves by elementary method, 
results which have been obtained by advanced 
analysis”. 
The fourth and final part of his research 
comprises a suggestion of a steoroscopic device 
for visualizing figures in four-dimensional space 
and his discussion with Bryan in this matter.
In 1912-1913, S D Mukhopadhyay 
had published his note on the steoroscopic 
representation of four-dimensional space [BCMS, 
4, (1912-1913):15]. Around the same time, Bryan 
had also published a paper in the same journal 
suggesting another kind of device. He had also 
claimed that it was superior to the one suggested 
by S D Mukhopadhyay. A reply to this criticism 
was also given by Syamadas Mukhopadhyay and 
it too was published in the Bulletin of the Calcutta 
Mathematical Society [BCMS, 6, (1914):55-56]. 
In that reply, Syamadas Mukhopadhyay wrote “I 
do not however see any good in further prolonging 
the controversy between us. Both of us have 
fairly stated our methods. It would lie with other 
mathematicians interested in this problem of four 
dimensions to accept or reject either”.
1.  The first two research papers of Professor Vaithyanathaswamy were titled “Parallel straight lines” [JIMS, 6(1), (1914):58-61] and 
“Length of a circular arc”[JIMS, 6(1), (1914):220-221]. These were in all likelihood the first research papers on Non-Euclidean 
Geometry published by an Indian.224 
Indian Journal of History of Science
Toward the end of his research career, S D 
Mukhopadhyay published two important papers 
entitled “Lower Segments of M-curves” and 
“Cyclic curves of an ellipsoid” in the Journal of 
the Indian Mathematical Society. Mukhopadhyay 
explained that the name M-Curve (Monotropic 
Curve) was due to the German geometrician 
Stackel H Mohrmann (1907-1934), who in 
adopting the name, gave the following precise 
definition. He said “A singularity-free (that which 
does not intersect itself) real branch of an analytic 
curve, which divides the Euclidean plane into two 
and only two regions, and for which the curvature 
at every finite point is limited and different 
from zero, will be called a limited monotropic 
curve or simply an  “M-curve”. [Mathematische 
Annalen].
In his investigations, S D Mukhopadhyay 
considered M-curves which are not necessarily 
analytic. He has characterized M-curves in a 
different way and investigated the associated 
problem.
4. Impact of Research (Reviews and 
Accolades)
W Blaschke, with regard to the paper 
“Cyclic curves of an ellipsoid” suggested in his 
lecture on “Selected Problems of Differential 
Geometry” in 1932 and said that the object of 
Dr. Mukhopadhyay’s paper is to study certain 
properties of cyclic curves on an ellipsoid, which 
is known to possess six vertices.
J S Hadamard of the Institute of France had 
a fair amount of interest in the researches carried out 
by S D Mukhopadhyay. In a letter dated February 
23, 1923, he opined on Professor Syamadas 
Mukhopadhyay’s  contributions in Synthetic, Non-
Euclidean and Differential Geometry and wrote 
“The interest of your researches on osculating 
conics, on even non-Euclidean geometry and 
parametric formulae in differential geometry of 
curves have been increased by comparison with 
memoirs published in a slightly different line by a 
Dane, Juel. Indeed the conjunction of both kinds 
of works (Juel dealing with straight lines, you 
with circles and conics), is likely at my seminar, 
to prove of great power and bearing for further 
improvement of geometry”.
Syamadas Mukhopadhyay published 
30 original papers in different national and 
international journals. Barring a few most of them 
were published by the University of Calcutta 
as “Collected Geometrical Papers by Professor 
Syamadas Mukhopadhyay” in two parts. The 
volumes were simultaneously reviewed in high-
end journals like Nature and the Bulletin of the 
American Mathematical Society and received 
favourable comments. The original texts from the 
journals are quoted below.
The review of Part I of the collection, as 
published in Nature of 1931 stated “The papers 
in this collection number ten on plane curves 
and seven on non-Euclidean, mainly hyperbolic 
geometry. The papers of the first group include six 
dealing with such topics as the geometrical theory 
of a plane non-cyclic arc, cyclic and sextactic points 
and a generalized form of Böhmer’s theorem, in 
which methods of pure geometry are employed, 
in several cases new methods of considerable 
interest. In this group, there are also four papers on 
the general theory of osculating conics, in which 
the methods of differential geometry are applied 
in rather a novel manner. The papers of the second 
group  also offer some new features, and amongst 
a number of interesting results may be noted an 
extension of the well-known correspondence 
between a right-angled triangle and a three-right-
angled quadrilateral in hyperbolic geometry, so 
as to include a regular pentagon. The book can 
be recommended to all who are interested in 
geometry, whether Euclidean or not, and wish to 
learn something of the progress of geometrical 
studies in Indian Universities.”[Nature, no. 3205, 
vol. 127, April 4, (1931):516]Historical Note: Syamadas Mukhopadhyay (1866-1937): A Reputed Geometrician 
225
The same collection of papers, were 
reviewed by Professor Virgil Snyder, in the 
Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 
in 1931 and the exact text of the review is quoted 
below. Professor Snyder wrote 
“The present collection contains 17 papers, 
previously published in Asiatic periodicals in the 
interval 1908-1928. The topics considered fall into 
three general heads, those concerning topological 
questions, including cyclic points, sextactic points, 
etc. of plane curves, those concerning triangles and 
quadrilaterals in hyperbolic geometry, and those on 
methods of visualizing representations of four way 
space. The methods are mostly those of elementary 
geometry, although differential expressions are 
used freely in the treatment of osculation. The 
proofs are strikingly direct and simple, and many 
of the theorems were first published previously to 
those obtained by others. For workers in topology, 
the Papers will be of real service.” [Bulletin of 
the American Mathematical Society, 36(No. 9), 
(1931):614]
The second volume of the collected papers 
was again reviewed in Nature in 1932. The review 
is quoted exactly as the published version was. It 
said 
“This volume is a continuation of the volume 
of papers by the same author published in 1929 
and reviewed in Nature of April 4, 1931, p. 516. 
There are two papers on plane convex ovals, 
but the chief part of the book consists of seven 
papers on the differential geometry of curves in 
an N-space. The latter are of special interest both 
on account of the original methods employed and 
the results obtained. They deal with parametric 
coefficients and their properties, the extension 
of the Serret-Frenet formulae to curves in the 
N-space, the expression of the co-ordinates in 
terms of the arc, curvatures at a singular point 
and osculating spherics. Unfortunately, the 
investigation is restricted to Euclidean space, 
but the author claims that, by the use of a certain 
distance formula, it can be adapted to any kind 
of non-Euclidean space without insurmountable 
difficulties. It would be of some interest if such a 
programme were actually carried out, if only for the 
four- and five-dimensional spaces used in relativity 
theory. The abstract nature of the topics dealt with 
makes the papers difficult to read, but students of 
algebraic geometry should find much to interest 
them. The book is clearly printed and unusually 
free from misprints, and is a credit to the Calcutta 
University Press.”[Nature, No. 3323, Volume 132, 
July 7(1933):48]
The review of the same collection of 
papers was done by Professor Virgil Snyder in the 
Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society in 
1932. He wrote “Part I of the Collected Papers was 
published in 1930, and reviewed in this Bulletin, 
Vol. 36(1931), p. 614. In Part II the pagination 
continues, and the make up is the same as that 
of Part I. It contains two recent essays on plane 
topology which appeared in the Mathematische 
Zeitscrhrift in 1931 and the Tohoku Mathematical 
Journal in 1931 respectively, and seven on 
parametric representation of curves in n-space, 
all but one of which (the Griffiths Memorial Prize 
Essay of 1910) were published in the Bulletin of 
the Calcutta Mathematical Society from 1909 
to 1915. The argument and point of view of the 
papers on topology are similar to those in Part I. 
Only elementary methods are employed, but with 
striking originality and richness in new results. 
Most of these concern cyclic and sextactic points 
on continuous ovals.
The other essays are on differential 
geometry of analytic curves in a Euclidean 
n-space. Properties are expressed in terms of 
determinants of derivatives of various orders of 
the coordinates as to the parameter.
The first intrinsic parameter is the arc 
length. The second is the projection of the area 
of the triangle formed by three points which 
approach coincidence on the curve, summed over 
the interval of integration, etc. A curve in S  has n 
such intrinsic parameters. They are independent 
of the coordinates chosen and of the parameter. 
Any n-1 independent equations connecting these 
parameters will determine a curve in S, intrinsically. 
The generalized idea of curvature, spheric of 
osculation, quadric of osculation etc. can now be 
expressed. The results in the case of plane curves226 
Indian Journal of History of Science
are compared with those obtained by projective 
differential geometry. The same ideas are then 
extended to curves in S. At times the amount of 
machinery necessary seems a bit bewildering, but 
one is soon consoled by an unexpected general 
theorem evolving from the maze of formulas. The 
various kinds of singular points and the associated 
parametric representation in series are treated in 
great detail. The papers contain a powerful weapon 
with which to attack metric problems on analytic 
curves of hyperspace”. [Bulletin of the American 
Mathematical Society, 38(7), (1932), p. 480]
The reviews from internationally reputed 
journals quoted above, as well as the comments 
made by the noted mathematicians of the time, 
clearly reflect the importance of the research 
conducted by Syamadas Mukhopadhaya and 
the interest that it generated in the mathematical 
arena of the thirties of the twentieth century. 
After his retirement from the Department of 
Pure Mathematics in 1932, S D Mukhopadhyay 
availed of the Ghosh Traveling Fellowship of the 
University of Calcutta and proceeded to Europe to 
study the methods of education followed there.
This also gave him a chance to personally 
interact with the eminent mathematicians of 
Europe. He utilized this opportunity and expounded 
his invented principles to the mathematical circle 
of the West. He also carefully studied the methods 
of education prevalent in the countries of Europe 
that he visited. On his return to India he wrote 
extensive memoirs based on his observations. After 
the death of Ganesh Prasad in 1935, Syamadas 
Mukhopadhyay was elected the President of the 
Calcutta Mathematical Society. He took a keen 
interest in all matters connected with the Society, 
till his death in 1937.
5. Concluding Remarks
Apart from the mathematician Syamadas 
Mukhopadhyay, a closer view of the man himself 
is very nicely portrayed by his eminent student 
G Bhar. He wrote
 “Mukhopadhyay was a man of broad sympathies 
and wide culture. He had an artistic bend of mind 
and was at one time a keen amateur photographer 
of no mean order. His love for the beautiful and 
the sublime found expression in his ardent passion 
for rose culture. His collection of roses in his 
country house at Mihijam is unique in India, and 
he enriched it every year by directly importing 
rose trees from England, France, Holland and other 
European countries”.
He was man of simple habits and a very 
private person who preferred to live away from the 
glamour of public life. He remained absorbed in 
his own work. Very correctly his another famous 
student M C Chaki observed “Mukhopadhyay left 
an example of plain living and high thinking”. On 
the 8th May, 1937, this great mathematician of 
India breathed his last.
This article is written in an effort to 
highlight and bring to the knowledge of the 
present generation the achievements of a great 
geometrician of India and also to preserve for 
posterity the memory of a man who contributed 
so handsomely to the world of mathematics.

JAGANNATH SAMRAT’S OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTION TO INDIAN
ASTRONOMY IN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY A.D.

M. L. SHARMA*

Department of Jyotish, Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, Varanasi

Jagannath Samrat was the Chief Pandit Astronomer in the court of Maharaja
Savai Jaisingh IL, the founder of Modern Jaipur and of five astronomical observatories
at Jaipur, Delhi, Muttra, Ujjain and Varanasi!. We do not know about his life in detail.
He was born in 1652 a.p.?. About his life Sudhakar Dwivedi says that in 1672 when
Maharaja Savai Jaisingh was on a defence mission to south India he met Jagannath,
who was then only twenty and very well-versed in Sastras. He brought Jagannath
to Jaipur to teach him Arabic and Persian. This perhaps he did to meet the challange
from the Emperor of Delhi that Sanskrit Pandits cannot learn Arabic and Persian. In
a short period Jagannath became well-versed in Arabic and Persian and also in Astro-
nomical works in those languages. The Maharaja then took him to Delhi and pre-
sented him to the Emperor. The emperor was so pleased with Jagannath that he imme-
diately appointed him his court Pandit. But later on Maharaja Jaisingh requested the
return of Jagannath who thereafter became the court Astronomer of Maharaja Jai-
singh®. Jagannath Samrat in the introduction of his work Siddhdnta Samrat praises
Maharaja Jaisingh and states that the work was written at the request of the Maharaja‘.
He refers to the Maharaja elsewhere also in that work. In the same book he mentions
some astronomical observations made in Saka 1651 (1729 a.p.) and 1652 (1730 a.v.)*.

The object of the paper is to clear misunderstandings about his works and to
explain the methods of his observations and analysis.

His Works

It is commonly believed that Jagannath Samrat translated two books from
Arabic into Sanskrit—Rekhdganita and Samrat Siddhdnta. Sudhakar Dwivedi
mentions only these two translated books in his Gapaka-Tarangini®, §. B. Dikshit
holds the same view’. Strongly enough the same view is expressed in ‘A concise
History of Science in India’ which quotes:

‘Jagannatha at the instance of his patron mastered Arabic and Persian and tran-
slated Ptolemy’s Al/magest and Euclid’s Elements from their Arabic version into

*Since deceased.

JAGANNATH SAMRAT’S OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTION TO ASTRONOMY 245

Sanskrit. The Samrat Siddhanta, the Sanskrit title of Almagest contains 13 chapters,
141 sections and 196 geometrical propositions: The Rekhaganita was the name given to
the Elements. In our opinion this view is not correct and we shall discuss this topic at
length.

First we shall discuss the book commonly known as Samrat Siddhadnta. A book
with this title was edited by Ram Swarup Sharma and published by Indian Institute of
Astronomical and Sanskrit Research, New Delhi, hereafter to be denoted by S.S.R.S.
From editing point of view this publication is very corrupt. However it gives us an
opportunity to see the whole text as commonly understood to be Samrat Siddhdnta,
because it begins with the statement:

Arabi Bhasaya Grantho Mijasti Namaka Sthitah chvaénakanam Subodhaya Girvanya
Prakatikrtah,

In Arabic language there is a work named Mijasti. For the sake of those, not
knowing Arabic it is translated into Sanskrit. It further states ‘This book has 13
chapters, 141 sections and 196 theorems to be proved with geometrical figures
(Ksetrani)’. Then there are thirteen chapters and one additional chapter Yantra-
dhyaya. Sudhakara Dwivedi quotes Yantradhydya as a part of Samrat Siddhdnta’.
S. B. Diksit also mentions Yantradhydya and its other sections (chapters) in the
copy lying in MSS collection of Anandagrama, Poona’®. But we think that the first
thirteen chapters mentioned in S.S. R.S. as Samrat Siddhdnta ate really Siddhdanta
Sara Kaustubha for the following reasons :

(a) In the beginning of the book just after the title Samrat Siddhantah it is
written in the form of a title ‘Sri Siddhanta Sara Kaustubha’.

(6) Jagannath Samrat has a style of mentioning the name of his Patron,
his own name and that of the book and the number of the chapter at the
conclusion of a chapter in his works. For example at the end of 15th
chapter of Rekhaganita he writes—Srimadrdjadhirdja prabhuvara Jaya-
simhasya tustyai Dvijendrah, Srimat Samrat Jagannatha iti Samabhi-
dharudhitenpranite. Granthesmin namni Rekhaganititi Sukondvabodhapra-
dataryadhydyaodhyetri Mohdpaha iha Viratimghasrasainogatobhut4. We
find such mentions at the end of almost all chapters in which the name
of the book is given as Siddhanta Sara Kaustubha. For example we quote
the verse at the end of first chapter.

Rajadhirdja prabhutosanarthe Samrét Jagannath krte Sug’ilpe Siddhantasare khalu
Kaustubhesmindhyaya adyoviratim Jagama.

(c) As we have already stated, the socalled Samrat Siddhanta has 13 chapters,

246

141 sections and 196 theorems to be proved with geometrical figures. From
the study of S.S.R.S.2 we find:

Thus we see that the whole book is covered in first 13 chapters and the
chapter (book) given under the caption of Yantradhydya is not a part
of the book translated from Mijasti or Almagest.

As regards the subject of the first thirteen chapters of S.S.R.S. and Yantra-
dhyaya, it is common in nature, but their treatment is quite different. While
the former part is clearly a translation, the latter part is written on tra-
ditional Indian style. For example, in the first chapter in the table of places
for the maximum length of day, latitude etc.1* We find that none of them
is situated in India. Similarly in the list of constellations’ which is bigger
than any such list in traditional literature the famous Saptarsi constellation
in translated as Bara Bhalu (big bear). The arrangement of the subject
is in prose and in a foreign style whereas in Yantradhydya the subject
is discussed in Indian style and in verses with an explanation in prose,
as we find in most of Siddhdnta texts. Thus we see that there is no simi-
larity in these two parts of a book. The whole of SSRS is more than
a book.

Like the beginning of first Chapter, the first thirteen chapters of SSRS,
Yantradhyaya has introductory verses of prayer and the statement that
the author is writing Samrat Siddhanta at the request of Maharaja Jaisingh.
These verses are the same which are quoted in the beginning of the first
chapter except verse 7, of that chapter. But there are three additional

JAGANNATH SAMRAT’S OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTION TO ASTRONOMY 247

verses No. 4, 7 and 9 and verse No. 6 of the first chapter is deleted in
Yantradhydya. This shows that it is a separaté book and not a part of
the translated book. Moreover Yantradhydya is divided into chapters
like those in other Siddhantas as Madhyamadhikara Spastddhikdra Tri-
prasnadhikdra etc. If Yantradhydya is a chapter of the main book, there
should be no division of chapters (adhydyas) in a chapter. In the chapter
of Jyotpatti in the socalled Yantrddhydya the treatment is like one found
in other Siddhanta texts and not like the one given in the first chapter
of the main book. Like other Siddhdnta texts it deals with sines and versed
sines of an arc. In Jyotpatti the use of a theorem is made with the state-
ment ‘Atha Mijasti Granthaya Prathamaddhydyasya Dwitiyaksetre Idamu-
papannan’> which means that it is proved in the second theorem of first
chapter of Mijasti, which is the part of the translation of Mijasti. If Yantra-
dhydaya is a part of the same book the statement should have been different.
Therefore it is proved beyond doubt that the chapter given at the end
of SSRS is not the part of the book given in the first thirteen chapters.
It is a separate work divided into many chapters like Yantrddhydaya,
Jyotpatti, Madhyamadhikara etc. The first thirteen chapters bear a separate
heading of Siddhanta Sara Kaustubha in the beginning and end of every
chapter. But there is no such thing in the other book. ( Yantradhyaya) .
Therefore we conclude that the book mentioned under caption Yantra-
dhyaya is real Samrat Siddhanta and the translation of Almagest is Sid-
dhanta Sara Kaustubha, It appears that by the misjudgment of a copyist
the introductory verse stating that Jagannatha is writing the work of
Samrat Siddhdnta was written in the beginning of Siddhanta Sara Kaustu-
bha alongwith some other verses and the fact could not be examined
because the work is very big having more than a thousand pages and
is very corrupt. I think Sudhakara Dwivedi on the basis of these verses
in the beginning of Siddhantad Sara Kaustubha termed the whole work as
Siddhanta Samrat. Since he was a great authority on the subject his version
was taken for granted and the mistake was perpetuated. On critical exami-
nation of the work the mistake was discovered and now M. D. Chaturvedi,
a younger colleague of mine, has edited the socalled Yantradhydya with
its real title Samrat Siddhdnta (SSMC) which is published by the Sanskrit
Parisad of Sagar University. Hereafter by the word Samrat Siddhanta
we will mean SSMD and not SSRS.

Thus we see that Jagannath Samrat wrote three books Rekhdganita, Siddhanta
Sara Kaustubha and Samrat Siddhanta. Of these the first two are translations of
books from Arabic and the third one is his own contribution to the subject. Before
coming to discuss the outstanding features of Samrat Siddhdnta we shall first give
a brief summery of these books. Rekhdganita—it is a translation of Elements of
Euclid from some Arabic work. The first chapter has 48 theorems, second 14, third
37, fourth 16, fifth 25, sixth 33, seventh 39, eighth 25, ninth 38, tenth 109, eleventh

248 M. L. SHARMA

41, twelfth 15, thirteenth 21, fourteenth 10 and fifteenth 6. Since these subject matter
is the same as that of Elements of Euclid we are not describing it.

Siddhanta Sara Kaustubha: \t is a translation of an Arabic work Mijasti which
is popularly known as A/magest. It has 13 chapters, 141 sections and 196 propositions
requiring geometrical proof. Subject matter of the first chapter is a general descrip-
tion of geocentric sphere, theorems on chords, tables of chords and halfchords,
spherical astronomy, tables of shadow, declination, etc. The second chapter describes
maximum day length, latitude midday shadow of a gnomon of given length on
equinoxes and solstices of some places and some other tables connected with the
diurnal motions of the sun. It is noteworthy that the places mentioned in these tables
are situated in the middle east or Europe. Third chapter deals with the motions of sun.
It is noteworthy that months mentioned in this chapter are Egyptian and Persian.
An astronomer named Batul Mayus is mentioned in this chapter. In connection
with an epoch the names of Alexander and Dus’manassar are also mentioned. Chapter
four deals with the motions of moon and connected tables. Chapter five deals with
celestial sphere, equation of centre, parallax, distance of moon and connected tables.
Chapter six deals with Eclipses and their projections. Chapter seven deals with stars
and, constellations, tables of co-ordinates of different stars of constellations. Chapter
eight also deals with stars and milky way. Chapter nine deals with the orbits of planets,
their mean motions, equation of centre and reduction of geocentric longitude. Chapter
ten also deals with the equation of centre and reduction to geocentric positions and
motions of Mercury. Chapter eleven deals with the motions of Venus, Mars, Jupiter
and Saturn and connected tables. Chapter twelve deals with retrograde motions.
Chapter thirteen deals with celestial latitude of planets and heliacal rising and setting
of planets.

Samrat Siddhanta—This book is not a translation of any Arabic or Persian
book but is an original contribution of the author to Indian Astronomy. It is written
in a traditional Siddhdnta text style of verse cum prose. It consists of five chapters;
Yantradhydya, Jyotpatti, Madhyamdadhikara, Spastadhikara and Triprasnaddhikara.
The book as it is available now and published by M. D. Chaturvedi is not complete.
Many important chapters like those on the eclipse of moon, the eclipse of sun on
shadow, heliacal rising and setting of planets etc. are missing. The author himself
refers his readers to see the method of construction of Samratyantra in Yantra Rachand-
dhydya: ‘Tatkaranaprakdro vedhaprakarsca yantra racanddhydye drastavyah’®,

In Yantraddhydya the author describes main features and method of observation
from the following instruments: (i) Nadivalaya or Nadiyantra, (ii) Golayantra,
(iii) Digamsayantra, (iv) Daksinodak bhitti yantra, (v) Vrtta Sasthamsa yantra,
(vi) Samrat yantra—Jaiprasa yantra and (vii) Kranti vrtta yantra. Besides these yantras
a very useful yantra, Jarakuli, is described in Spastadhikara and Yamyottara yantra

ference of masonary instruments against brass instruments. In Jyotpatti the writer

starts the subject in traditional manner, but gives advance knowledge of the subject.
He gives methods of finding sines of sum and difference of two arcs, sines of a
double arc, sine of 3 times of an arc, sine of one third of an arc, sine of 5 times of an
arc and sine of 1/5th of an arc, sine of of an arc, sines of 30°, 45°, 18°, 72°. He also
gives Uluk-Beg’s method for finding sine of 1/3rd of an arc. He also gives rules for
finding versed sines. In Madhyamadhikara he describes traditional nine measures of
time, time measures in a Kalpa, Bhagana (complete revolutions) of planets etc. in
a Kalpa, calculation of Ahargana, finding of mean planets, mean motions of planets,
Khakaksa, orbits of planets, measures of discs of planets, madhya and spasta cir-

and azimuth, length of a day, Bhavas Natkala, latitude in Southern hemisphere
and celestial latitude. It is to be noted that he quotes verses from Bhaskara, Kamata-
kara and Sirya Siddhadnta at several places.

To understand the importance of his work we must note the position of Indian
Astronomy, before and after his time. After Bhaskarcarya II, the only astronomer
who wanted to evolve methods of calculation of planets tallying with observed position
was Ganesa (b. 1507 A.D.) the author of Grahalaghava. Other astronomers were either
contented with writing commentaries on old texts or writing texts on old patterns
suggesting minor corrections on the basis of their improved knowledge of mathematics.
One such astronomer was Kamalakara. But he was very orthodox in astronomical
matters. He regarded Siirya Siddhanta like Veda and could not tolerate any deviation
from its principles. After Jagannath Samrat we do not have any astronomer of his
calibre.

Jagannath was very well versed in Indian Astronomy and had mastered Arabic
system of Astronomy. He was also in touch with European astronomers. He wanted
to evolve correct methods to find the true positions of planets tallying with observed
positions. He wanted to know the correct principles for true motions of planets.
He says it requires a long time to come to a conclusion. So the kings should esta-
blish observations to know the positions of planets, by observations. Enumerating
the efforts of Maharaja Jaisingh he says that, besides setting observations at different
places in India, he sent a scholar named Mohammad Sarif to western countries
(Phirangdesa). He determined latitude at Mahil deva island which was 4° 12’ S.
From Surat he sent for Gola of European countries. He sent Mohammad Mehandi
to collect astronomical data from further islands. Thus he sent astronomers in all

250 M. L, SHARMA

countries and in all directions to observe planets and collect observed data. He says
such efforts should be continued by other rulers also’.

He felt that observational instruments were to play an important role in the
development of astronomical knowledge. Therefore he gave first importance to
instruments in his work Samrat Siddhdnta. Besides some useful traditional instru-
ments like Yamyottarayantra and Nadivalaya he describes the other instruments
of observatories set up by his patron Jaisingh. He also describes the method of observa-
tion with the help of those instruments.

He was a great observer himself. He determined the obliquity of ecliptic very
correctly. He says that at Delhi it was observed by some one to be 23° 39’. In Arabia
it was observed to be 23° 51’ 19” by Astronomer Avarakhas (7?) and others. In Greece
at latitude 36° it was observed to be 23° 51’ 15” by astronomer Vatal Majus (7).
At Samarkand at latitude 39° 37’ Uluk Beg found it to be 23° 30’ 17” and he in
1651 Saka (1729 A.p.) observed at Delhi (ndraprastha) to be 23° 28’, the result which
almost tallies with the modern value of the same. He also observed precession of
equinox (Ayanaméas) to be 19° 37’ in the same year. He determined the rate of pre-
cession to be 1° in 70 years. According to him year of zero precession of fixed Hindu
sphere was 278 Saka (356 A.D.)!8. He also tried to know the position of aphelion and
eccentricity of the solar (earth’s) orbit. For that he made four observations of the
Sun on vernal equinox day of the year 1651 Saka at 18 ghatis and 57 palas in the same
year when increasing declination of the sun was 22° 19’ again in the same year when
the sun was near the other equinox point and in the next year when the sun was near
the Vernal equinox. By these observations and mathematical analysis he found the
correct value of eccentricity (Parama Mandaphala) to be 1° 55’, 58"" 2” and aphelion
3 16°/42""/48 1772,

He does not take anything for granted. He says that Kamalakara takes the
value of m to be +/ 10 and criticises Bhaskara for having a different value. But this
fact was examined by all astronomer technicians carefully and they found that the
yalue of Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) was correct and not of Kamalakara®.

In connection with manda phala he examined the rules of Bhaskara and Kamala-
kara. He finds that sine of mandaphala should have mandakarna as a divisor and
not trijya. For this error he criticised Bhaskara, Kamalakara and others?!,

He made an attempt to give a proof of corrections for manda and sighra phalas
which had never been tried by others. He also suggested many new methods of correct
observation by very simple instruments and evolved new rules for calculations specially
in the chapter of Triprasna. His work is an attempt to evolve rules for correct calcu-
lations of position of planets tallying with the observed positions. He says in Madhya-
madhikdra, “When in Siddhdntas like Brahma Siddhanta and Siirya Siddhanta which
are supposed to be written by R. Sies calculated planets do not tally with the observed

JAGANNATH SAMRAT’S OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTION TO ASTRONOMY 251

positions, it is clear that the position of sky (planetery rate of motion) undergoes
a change. If the sky was fixed then the calculations from all Siddhantas at all times
must be the same. Even then we have taken traditional method of finding mean
position of planets for the benefit of Society and have calculated them with the appli-
cation of Bija and other corrections so that they tally with the observed positions™.

In the conclusion we can say that Samrat Siddhdnta is different from Siddhanta
Sara Kaustubha which is really the translation of A/magest and in this work Jagannath
Samrat has broken the traditional line of depending on traditional constants and
showed the future astronomers to rely on observed results and to base their rules

on them.

ECLIPSES

Since remote antiquity occultations of heavenly bodies attracted the attention of
man and inspired him to find the time of recurrence of such events. The occultations
of the Moon with yogatéras (junction stars or the identifying stars) of asterisms on its
path (lunar zodiac) and conjunctions of other planets too with stars, or any other
planet, likewise generated great interest. The most important occultation of the
Moon with the Sun resulting in solar eclipse and of Moon itself, by the
Earth’s shadow leading to the lunar eclipse, might have proved very
fascinating events. The earliest attempts to know their recurrence timings were based
on determination of empirical cycles by observing colours of eclipses and identifying
them as brown colour shading or dark colour shading etc. These were the attempts
to find repetition cycles of eclipses of the same kind (colour). In fact, the colour of
an eclipse depends upon the elongation of nodes of lunar orbits w.r.t. Sun which
determines how intense (brown dark or deep dark etc.) the eclipse will be as a result
of relative gradations in extents of overlapping. In ancient civilizations like China,
Babylon, etc. records of eclipses had been kept. Ptolemy had a record of eclipses from
747 B.c. to 150 a.p. These records on analysis gave metonic cycle. It is believed that
the Chinese might have this cycle earlier. In India, in early Vedic times there were
periods determined on the basis of such observational records over centuries. We
find a period of 20000 days, and it is clear that

2000 days = 56 lunar years + 3 months
= 675 lunations = 3 (18 years —- 9 m)
= 3 Periods of lunar node (Rahu).

Thus the above mentioned cycle is justified. Early Vedic Aryans distinguished
3 different colours of eclipses (solar and lunar separately), i.e. black, red and white
and tried to recognize periods of eclipses with specific colours.? On dividing the above
figure (2000 days) by the number of colours (3) one gets the period of occurrence of
eclipses of the same colour. This is almost equal to the period of Rahu or Ketu (the
ascending and descending nodes of lunar orbit). The Jaina texts like Stryaprajiapti*
mention five colours of eclipses, which is an advancement over the observations of
Vedaiga Jyotisa tradition. There is mentioned a cycle of 6 months.4 We know that

675 lunations=3 Chaldean saros-+-6 months.
Thus the period of 6 months is also one of the shortest cycles, easily conceiv-
able in early studies of solar and lunar eclipses.

ECLIPSES, PARALLAX, AND PRECESSION OF EQUINOXES 189

Inthe Vedaiga Fyotisa we do not find algorithms for computing eclipses, but there
is a reference to a phenomenon of colouration which is referred to as Vyatipata yoga.*
This was the phenomenon (of colouration of Sun and Moon) for predictions of which,
there were developed some methods in Jaina traditional astronomy.’ Reference to
this phenomenon occurs in Paitamaha Siddhanta also. In Siddhantic texts later,
this phenomenon got interpreted as the occurrence of equality of declinations of the
Sun and the Moon. It may be remarked that occurrence of Vyatipdta yoga later got
connected with a gencral form equality of declinations (Kranti sémya) irrespective
of their signs (see appendix). The methods of computing timings of this phenomenon
developed from Vedic times and we find detailed methods of computing the
occurrence of this in Jaina texts too. Fyotisa Karandaka’ gives detailed methods of
computing its reoccurrence in five year yuga of Vedic and post-Vedic tradition. But
there were no other yogas completing the list of 27 as found in later astronomical
texts. Almost all the theoretical treatises after Aryabhata have dealt with the problem
of kranti sémya (equality of declinations of Sun and Moon) in details.

The Jaina canonical text has reference to two types of Rahus, one of them being
responsible for waxing and waning of the phases of Moon? (1/15th part of the lunar
disc every day) while the other one was considered responsible for eclipses. There
are five categories of this Rahu depending upon the direction of Ist and last contacts
and nature of eclipses® (like being partial, total or annwar). There are no records
preserved in the literature on the basis of which they inferred the cycles but it was
concluded that the Parva Rahu (responsible for eclipses) covers! the Sun or Moon
at least once in six months and excellently Moon in 42 months and Sun in 48 years
as discussed earlier. Jainas had records of 5 colours and concluded these cycles on
the basis of these colours. The mathematical analysis of these findings is discussed by
Sharma et al.11 using number of theoretical methods. In brief: for lunar eclipse 42
eclipse months ~~, 41 lunations and for solar eclipse 45 years = 48 eclipse years.

In later texts, after Vedic and Jaina canonical literature, we see the development
of computational algorithms to predict eclipses. The notion of Rahu got developed
and the lunar ascending node was named after the same.

In the Paftcasiddhantika of Varahamihira, Vasistha and Romaka Siddhantas give
algorithms for computing eclipses using the longitudes of Sun and Moon. The rules
for computing eclipses are as follows :—

Rule I

(1) (A) For the lunar eclipse, find the difference D in longitudes of the near node
and the Moon. If this is less than 13° Junar eclipse will take place, when
she is in opposition to the Sun,

(B) (a) Time* of the beginning of eclipse is given by :
T= T — 3/20V/169—D?

*Here the time is given in hours and minutes; if the time is expressed in nagikds the factors
preceding the root should be 3/8.

190 HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY IN INDIA

(b) Time of the ending of eclipse is given by :
T2= T + 3/20 /169—p?2
where T is the time of opposition.

Rule H

(2) (A) Let the latitude of the Moon at that time be f in minutes of arc. If AA is
the hourly change in elongation of the Moon with respect to Sun, then the
time for the beginning of eclipse is given by :

Ty= T — »/552—B2/AX (I)

Time for the ending of eclipse is given by:

Ty= T+ ¥552—By AX (11)
(B) T’= TF 21/5 AAV25— 8B? gives beginning and end of partial maximum
or total eclipse. (IID)

Here it is clear that when the difference in longitudes of the node and the Moon
is 13°,-+ the latitude of the Moon is taken to be 55’ which means that near the node
the latitude is assumed to change 55’/13 minutes per degree. The sum of radii of Sun
and Moon is (from I) :

Tm + 1, = 55’
Their difference (from ITI) is

1, —~%m = 21""

r, = 38’ Tm_ AT
which are taken to be constants,
The middle of eclipse is at T, the duration is zero ifr, + 1,, =f.

The results are based on mean motions of the Sun and the Moon as hourly
variations in longitudes are neglected.

The first rule is more primitive as it ignores the latitude of the Moon. Paulifa-
siddhanta discusses the method for computing solar eclipses. Here the parallax in
longitude is converted to the time correction for conjunction (sce the discussion
parallax Eq. (1) later on). Romaka-siddhanta gives an improved version for computing
solar eclipse. It is this text which uses tribhona-lagna (nona-gesimal) for the first
time. This very text gives parallax correction in latitude (i.e. the natisamskara) in
addition to parallax correction in longitude.

The Sirya-siddhania in Paftcasiddhantika of Warahamihira gives a better and
more refined method for computing solar eclipse and uses far better constants. Like
in Romaka, it uses true motions and consequently more correct parallaxes and angular
diameters. The true motion of the Moon at the time of eclipse is used instead of true

ECLIPSES, PARALLAX AND PRECESSION OF EQUINOXES 191

daily motion. Parallax-corrected conjunction time is computed using parallax-
corrected longitudes. A separate chapter is devoted for graphical representation of
eclipses, To mark the points of Ist and last contacts, the Moon’s position is to be
fixed with respect to east-west of the observer. For this purpose, two corrections
aksa valana (depending upon latitude of the place of observation) and dyanavalana
(depending upon the Moon’s ayana w.r. to equinoxes) are to be applied to the east
west point. But in computing aksavalana versed sine is used instead of sine of the hour
angle which is a mistake as pointed out by Bhaskaracarya IT. Vasistha does not give
dyana valana, but the Sirya-siddhanta gives fairly accurate formula. The Romaka-siddhanta
is silent about directions of Ist and last contacts.

The Aryabhatiya and Mahabhaskariya give same method of computing parallaxes,
angular diameters and valana. These compute parallaxes separately for the Sun and
Moon and then take the difference. In the case of the Moon the same is taken in her
own orbit instead of in ecliptic. It is interesting to note that Mahabhdaskariya uses
parallax in computing lunar eclipse also, but it does not result in any difference in
final figures.

ALGORITHM FOR COMPUTING Ecuipses IN PRESENT
RECENSION OF SURYA-SIDDHANTA

Having surveyed the developments historically, let us discuss in brief the work-
ing algorithm for computing eclipses according to the present version of the Sérya-
siddhanta, then we would like to comment on the successes and failures of
these methods in the light of the equations of centre being applied to the Sun, other
constants being used and the theoretical formulations involved therein. Before start-
ing the actual computations, one shculd first check the possibility of occurrence of
eclipse. It may be pointed out that in Indian tradition, the ecliptic limit was taken
to be 14° elongation of Rahu at the moment of syzygies. The limit is same for lunar
and solar eclipse; because it was computed using mean radii of Sun and Moon and
the parallax was neglected.

Lunar Eclipse

At the time of ending moment of purpima (full moon) one should compute the
true longitudes of Sun, Moon and ascending node (Rahu). The apparent disc of the
Sun in lunar orbit is calculated using their mean diameters. Also the cross section
of earth’s shadow in the lunar orbit is computed. From the diameters of the
overlapping bodies, and latitude of the Moon, position of Rahu, one can easily infer
whether the eclipse will be complete or partial. The half of the time of eclipse 7,
(sthityardha) is given by

60 Dt Dd, \t ;
ji = —— ——__— ) — B? ghatis
7 ZV ( 2 ) Re

where V,,= daily velocity of Moon, V, = daily velocity of Sun, B=latitude of moon
and D,, D, stand for angular diameters of overlapping bodies (Earth’s shadow and

192 HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY IN INDIA

Moon in case of lunar eclipse). Thus the beginning (sparfa or Ist contact) and ending
(moksa or last (4th) contact) are given by

T,+ 7, where T, is the time of opposition.

Similarly half ofthe time of full or maximum overlap (vimardardha) will be
given by

60 D,~ D,\?
T= i ) B2 ghatis.
: Vi—V, v( 2 gras:

and T,+ T, will be the moments of beginning and ending of full overlap (vimarda).
(These are the timings for sammilana and unmilana in traditional terminology which
indicate the positions when the two bodies touch internally). Thus one gets the 3rd
and 4th contacts also.

In order to have better results, the positions of the Sun, Moon and Rahu are
computed at the instant of the middle of the eclipse and using these the required
arguments are recomputed and again the sthityardha and vimardardha are computed.
The procedure is recursive and is expected to improve the results. The Sirya-siddhanta
gives also the formulae for eclipsed fraction (maximum and instantaneous) which
are easily provable on the basis of the geometry of the eclipse phenomenon. Also it
gives the formula for remaining time of eclipse if the eclipsed fraction is given after
middle of the eclipse which is just the reverse process.

After giving algorithms for computing eclipses, the dksa-and dyana-valanas are
to be computed to know the directions of Ist and last contacts. The formulae are
sin Z x sin @

cos 8

aksa-valana = sin ~1 (

where Z = zenith distance, 6 = latitude of the place of observation and
§ = declination.

If the planet is in the eastern hemisphere then dksa-valana is north and if the
planet is in the western hemisphere then this is south.
sin « X Cos *)

Gyana-valana = sin ~1
cos 6

where A = longitude of the eclipsed body. If both the valanas have same sign, then
sphuta-valana = aksa-valana + dyana-valana.
If they have opposite sign, then

Sphufa-valana = aksa-valana — ayana-valana.

The sphuta-valana divided by 70 gives the valana in angulas. The valanas
are computed for the Ist and last contacts, These give the points where the Ist and

ECLIPSES, PARALLAX, AND PRECESSION OF EQUINOXES 193

last contacts take place on the periphery of the disc of the eclipsed body with
regard to east-west direction of the observer. One can also compute valanas
for sammilana and unmilana too and decide also their directions.

Solar Eclipse

The Sirya-siddhanta gives the formula for parallax in longitude and latitude. The
algorithms of various texts for computing the same are discussed in the next section
on parallax. Here we give the rules used in Sérya-siddhanta.

(1) Compute udayajya = sin A x sin

cos 6
where A = the sdyanalagna = longitude of ascendant at ending moment of amavasya
(computed using udaydsus or timings for rising of rasis).

cos 8 = cosine of latitude = lambajya.

(2) Compute the longitude of dafamafagna using udaydsus. Calculate the declina-
tion 8p for this longitude.

(3) If 8, and @ have same direction, subtract the two, otherwise add them. The
result is the zenith distance Zp of the dasama lagna (madhya-lagna in the terminology
of Stirya-siddhanta in chapter on solar eclipse).

sin (Zp) is called madhyajya.

(4) Compute drkksepa using the formula

drkksepa = \/ (madtyaya)*— ( Ratipabe * wdape )*
R

where R is standard radius adopted for tables of sines etc. (=3438' in Sarya-siddhanta)
(5) drggatijya = R2—(drkksepa)? == fanku.

Approximately one can also take sin (Zp) to be drkksepa and cos (Zp) to be
drggati. Siirya-siddhanta gives this approximation too and defines

R

vislesimfa, V = tribhona lagna — Sun’s longitude, (0) ¢ 5;
= A—90—S,

sin (V)

chheda

chheda =

lambana = east or west in ghajis.

If the Sun is east of the tribhona-lagna then the /ambana is east and if Sun is west
of the tribhona-lagna, lambana is west,

194 HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY IN INDIA

Note that in the approximation here it has been assumed that zenith distances
of madhyalagna and tribhona-lagna are equal (in fact these differ a little). This appro-
ximation does introduce some error in lambana.

(6) Compute also the /ambana for the longitude of the Moon.

If S, > A—90°, the Sun is cast of tribhona-lagna. In this case subtract the difference
of lambanas of Sun and Moon from the ending moment of amavasya otherwise add
the two. The result is the parallax corrected ending moment of amavasya. Compute
the longitudes of Sun and Moon for this moment and recalculate the lambanas and
again the better /embana corrected ending moment of amavasya. Go on correcting
recursively till the results do not change.

Now compute the nati samskara for correcting the latitude of the Moon using the
formula :

(Vi, — Vy) x drkksepa

I5R
= 49 drkksepa/R = 49 drkksepa/3438
= drkksepa/70.

nati =

Apply the nati correction to the latitude of the Moon. Using the parallax-
corrected ending moment of amavasya and nati-corrected latitude of Moon, compute
the timing for Ist contact (sparfa) 2nd contact (sammilana- time for touch internally,
indicating full overlap) 3rd contact (uamilana—start of getting out, indicating touch
of the other edge internally) and the eclipsed fraction, aksa-valana, dyana-valana ete.,
using the same formulae as given in case of the lunar eclipse. The only difference is
that here the eclipsed and eclipsing bodies are Sun and Moon, while these were the
Moon and Earth’s shadow in case of the lunar eclipse.

In the next chapter (Parilekhddhikara} Siirya-siddhanta gives the method of depict-
ing the phenomena of contacts etc. diagrammatically using the mdnaikya-khanda
and mandntara-khanda (D,-+-D,)/2 and the valanas (to indicate the directions of Ist
and last contacts). Such a diagrammatical depiction of eclipses is found almost in
every standard text of Hindu traditional astronomy. The details of the method
employed are elaborately given by Mahavira Prasada Srivastava.

The illustrative examples for computing lunar and solar eclipses are given by
Mahavira Prasada Srivastava!4 and also by Burgess.

Tt is worthwhile to discuss here how far successfully could Sirya-siddhanta predict
solar and lunar eclipses. It may be remarked that the methods as such are quite right
but the data used sometimes lead to failure of predictions. The main difference lies
in the equations of centre to be applied to the Moon. It may be remarked that the
mean longitude of Moon in Sirya-siddhanta is quite correct but the corrections like
variation, annual variation, evection etc, (which result from expansion of

ECLIPSES, PARALLAX AND PRECESSION OF EQUINOXES 195

gravitational perturbation function for the 3-body problem of Earth-Moon-Sun
system in terms of Legendre polynomials of various orders) are lacking. There are
thousands of terms for correcting longitude of the most perturbed heavenly body, the
Moon. At least nearly fifty or eleven or most unavoidably 4 or 5 corrections are
required to be applied to the longitude of Moon and to its velocity, to get satisfactory
results. Even if only Muiijala’s correction (evection) is applied, there may result an
error of the order of 3° in longitude of Moon!* even at syzygies.

It may be remarked here that the Siirya-siddhanta (S.S.) applies only one equation
of centre (the mandaphaia) in the longitudes of Sun and Moon. In fact the amplitudes
for mandaphalas of Sun and Moon were evaluated using two specific eclipses. These
were so selected as follows :

(1) One eclipse (solar or lunar) in which the Moon was 90° away from her apogee
(or perigee) and Sun on its mandocca (lines of apses)

(2) Second eclipse in which the Sun was 90° away from its mandocca (or mandanica)
and Moon was at her apogee.

Although we do not have records of these eclipses for which the data on manda-
phala were fitted, it is evident that the eclipses might have been so selected that in
one case the mandaphala of one of them is zero and maximum for the other and vice-
versa in the second case. It is clear that the amplitudes of mandaphalas in these cases
will be the figures used in Sarya-siddhdnta. The maximum mandaphala (Ist equation of
centre) for Sun is 2°-10’ and for Moon its amplitude is 5°. The actual value in case
of Sun being 1°55’ which along with the amplitude of annual variation 15’ amounts
to the amplitude (=2°10’) given in Sirya-siddhanta. This evidently indicates that the
annual variation got added to the equation of centre of Sun with the sign changed
which is also clear if the above-mentioned cases of fitting of data are analysed theoreti-
cally. It may be remarked that the S.S. equation of centre of Moon does not have
annual variation so that at least the éithi is not affected by this exchange of the annual
variation from Moon to the Sun (as the sign too got changed).

Now it is evident that only those eclipses which conform to the situations given
above, (for which the data fitting was done) will be best predicted and the eclipses
in which the Sun, Moon are not at their above mentioned nodal points, may not be
predicted well or may be worst predicted if they are 45° away from these points on
their orbits. The error in longitude of Moon is maximum near astami (the
eighth 4ith:)17 and it is minimum upto 1/2° near syzygies. There had been cases of
failure of predictions in the past centuries and attempts were made by Ganesa
Daivajfia, Kesava and others to rectify and improve the results. The timings may
differ or even sometimes in marginal cases, the eclipse may not take place even if
so predicted using data of Siirya-siddhanta or sometimes it may take place even if not
predicted on the basis of Sirya-siddhanta, The difference in timings (between the one
predicted on the basis of Sirya-siddhanta and the observed one) are quite often noted
in some cases even by the common masses!* and for that reason now paficéiga-makers

196 HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY IN INDIA

are using the most accurate data (although the formulae used in general are the same)
for computing eclipses,

The modern methods of computing eclipses use right ascensions and declinations,
while Indian traditional methods use longitudes and latitudes and parallax in the
ending moments of syzygies (and nati in latitude of Moon). The instantaneous
velocities are not used. The daily motions even if true, but without interpolations,
on being used introduce errors. The locus of shadow cone and the geometry of overlap
in the framework of 3-dimensional coordinate geometry is not utilised. The recursive
processes do improve the results and the formulae as such are all right but the errors
in the true longitudes and latitudes of Sun and Moon and in their velocities lead to
appreciable errors.

In fact even Bhaskaracarya in his Bijopanaya!® discussed most important correc-
tions like hybrids of annual variation and variation but missed evection which was
earlier found by Mufijala in his Laghumanasa, In 19th a.v, Candrasekhara gave annual
variation. If corrections due to Mufijala, Bhaskaracarya and Candra Shekara are
applied simultaneously, results improve remarkably.

In the last century of Vikrama Samvat and also in the last forty years of present
century of Vikrama era many Indian astronomers like Ketakara® and others
advanced the methodology of calculation of eclipses using longitudes and latitudes
and prepared sdranis (tables) for lunar and solar eclipses (for whole of global sphere).
These tables yield very much accurate results.

APPENDIX

If the Sun and Moon have equal declinations with same sign in different ayanas,
the yoga was termed vyatipata and if the signs were opposite but still thé magnitudes
were equal in same ayanas then it was termed as vaidhrti (See fig. 7.1—I1(a)(b)). In
later developments the yogas were given a much more general meaning and these

were defined as sum of longitudes of Sun and Moon. Yogas were defined as a continu-
ous function to knew the time or day of vyatipaia and Vaidhyti_ yogas. The idea of using

this parameter is easily expected because if the latitude of the moon’s orbit is neglected
then for equality of declinations,

sin S; = sin M,

where S, and M, stand for longitudes of Sun and Moon respectively which shows,
if S;=M,, $8, =180°-—-M, or 8, +My, =180°.

Thus the sum of longitudes was treated as a parameter. In order to study the
variation of this parameter there were defined 27 yogas in siddhantic texts. This
attempt may be visualised as one of the earliest attempts to compute the day (or time)
of eclipse or to have an idea of occurrence of eclipse. Jaina texts mention cyatipata
and vaidhyti yogas. Fyotiskarandaka gives a method .of computing only uyatipata yogas
in a 5-year yuga. It may be noted that vaidhyti was first defined in Paulisa-Siddhanta
(300 8.c.) But the list of 27 yogas was computed by Mufijala (10th century .p.). The
method of computing Ardntt sémya (timings of equality of declinations) is given in
all texts (see “‘yotirganitam’’ Patadhikara).

PARALLAX (LAMBANA)

Theoretically computed positions of planets (using ahargana and equation of
centre), are geocentric. Since the observer is in fact on the surface of the Earth, a
correction on that account must be applied at the time of observations. The difference
between the positions of a planet as seen from the centre and from surface of the earth
is called lambana-samskara (parallax-correction) or simply the /ambana. In siddhantic
texts like Siirya-siddhanta etc. it is discussed in the beginning of the chapter on solar
eclipse, as this correction depends upon the position of observer and the zenith
distance of the planet at the time of observation and thus must be applied in astrono-
mical phenomenon like eclipse. Geometrically we have shown the geocentric position

It may be remarked that the parallax was appearing in the data on
lunar observations in early astronomical traditions of pre-siddhantic period, because
the observations were being performed at the time of moonrise and moonset. In
these cases maximum value of parallax (horizontal parallax) appeared in their data.
In Purénas and in Jaina literature in Prakrta!* there are statements in which it is
mentioned that Moon generating its mandalas travels higher than the Sun. The state-
ment is usually misinterpreted as mentioning Moon being at larger distance from
Earth than the Sun. In fact in such statements the “height”? means the latitudinal or
declinational height in the daily diurnal motion in mandalas (i.e. in spiral-like paths).
It is evident that Moon goes upto declinational height of 28°.5 and Sun only upto
the declinational height of 23°.5 in Jambidvipa. In fact the statements give heights
in units of yojanas which are just the heights like the ones above sea level. Thus the
statements in Puranas and Jaina astronomical texts like Sirya-prajfiapti mentioning
Moon travelling above the Sun, are justified. It is found that?* 510 yojanas=28,,,

in Prakrta texts of Jainas it is found that latitude of Moon arrived at is 7°.37. The
actual value of latitude of Moon including parallax is 6°.64 (the actual value without
parallax==5°). According to the Jaina literature the estimated parallax of the Moon
is quite large due to experimental errors. In Pauliga-siddhanta the latitude®* of the
Moon is given to be 4° 30’, but one verse gives 4°40’ and there is also a verse *4 giving
7°.83. This very text gives parallax in longitude in terms of ghatikds to be added to or
subtracted from the time of ending moments of amdvdsya (new moon conjunction).
The formula can be written in the following form?

goes higher than Sun by 80 yojanas= ( Js = 7°.37. Thus using the data given

parallax = 4 sin (hour angle of Sun) ghatis. (1)

In Sérya-siddhanta we do not find much details in defining parallax geometrically
but the later texts of the siddhantic tradition have all relevant details. Stirya-siddhanta
starts discussing parallax in longitude and latitude stating that parallax in longitude
(harija) of Sun is zero when it is in the position of madhya-lagna®* (ascendant—90°)
and the parallax correction in latitude (nati or avanati) is zero where the northern
declination of the madhya-lagna equals the latitude of the place of observation. These
facts can be easily visualised applying spherical trigonometrical formulae to solve
the relevant spherical triangles. Sérya-stddhanta and other texts in Indian traditional
astronomy discuss the parallax corrections in longitude and latitude only.

Bhdskaracarya I (629 a.p.)* in Mahabhaskariyam, followed Aryabhata’s method.
Brahmagupta® in his treatise Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta criticized the approach by
Aryabhata. His objection is that dygjya is the hypotenuse; drkksepajyd is the base,
hence (2) is not valid, but we have shown that this is correct.2® Brahmagupta’s criti-
cism is valid only if the arc between the central ecliptic point and the planet, stands
for drggati as defined by him.

Brahmagupta’s method of computing Jambana is based on evaluating five R
sines (chord sines)?! as follows :

(1) If 6 = the latitude of the place,
8c = the declination of the ecliptic point (c) on the meridian.
madhyajya (as already defined) = R sin (zenith distance of the meridian ecliptic
point)

where V,, and V, stand for the daily motions of the Sun and the Moon.

Bhaskaracarya gave simpler algorithm for computing horizontal parallaxes of
planets. According to this algorithm the daily velocity of planet divided by 15 gives
the parallax.3* This formula is quite evident because the parallax of any planet is the
radius of the Earth in the planet’s orbit. The radius of the Earth = 800 yojanas and
daily velocity of each planet according to Sirya-siddhanta is equal to 11858.72 yojanas.
We know that the ratio of the daily orbital motions = ratio of the orbit’s radii. Hence

Parallax p = a (in units of those of velocity).

Since day = 60 ghatis, hence horizontal parallax is almost the angular distance
travelled. by planet in 4 ghafis. It may be remarked that in fact the distances
(in yojanas), daily travelled by planets are not the same, hence the results
were inaccurate. The following table shows the figures for comparison. ®

Later Kamalakara Bhatta who compiled his Siddhanta-tativa-viveka® in 1656 a.v.
made an exhaustive analysis of the lambana and nati corrections. This is by far the
most detailed analysis. He criticised Bhaskaracarya’s approach as well as the treat-
ment done by Munisvara in Siddhanta-sarvabhauma and pointed out the approximations,
used by them in their derivations. It may be remarked that Kamalakara’s treatment
is probably the most exhaustive of all the treatments available in astronomical
literature in Sanskrit. He has categorised /ambana corrections in various elements and
gave sophisticated spherical trigonometric treatment in order to study the values in
different geometrical positions for applications in solar eclipse computations.

It may be noted that in Indian astronomy, /ambana is applied in observations of
Moon, moonrise and moonset and in computing solar eclipses etc. but it was never
applied in tithis, which have same ending moment all over the global sphere.3® It was
not applied in computing cusps of Moon but the same should have been applied.37

It may be pointed out that the advancements in developing formulae for
computing lambana and nati by Indian astronomers upto Kamalakara Bhatta (before
Newton) are very much appreciable, but these corrections were done in longitude
and latitude only, in terms of parallax in zenith distance and no formulae for parallax
corrections in right ascension and declination were developed because eclipses were
calculated using ecliptic coordinates only and never the equatorial coordinates.

PRECESSION

From Vedic and Post-Vedic literature, it can be easily inferred that the
phenomenon of precession was qualitatively known to Indian astronomers of those
times although its velocity was not known. We find the lists of lunar asterisms (nak-
satras), starting with Sravistha (Dhanistha—an asterism of lunar zodiac identifiable
with the star alpha or beta delphini) at the time of Vedanga-JZyotisa® and the list
found in Jaina literature®® has asterism Abhijit (identified as Vega star a-Lyrae) as
the Ist asterism (the positions of nodal points of ecliptic at the time of Sirya-prajnapti
are shown in the figure 8.1), which clearly indicates that the starting naksatra was
changed from time to time, whenever an appreciable change got accumulated in the
position of winter solstice among the stars. According to B.G. Tilak® there were also
times when spring equinox was in the constellation Mrgasgirsa (the “Orion”) which
corresponds to the position of winter solstice in the asterism Uttarabhadrapada,
3 naksatras (about 40°) ahead of Dhanistha naksatra. In fact there were two types of
traditions developed in vedic and post-vedic period.‘! According to one tradition

ECLIPSES, PARALLAX AND PRECESSION OF EQUINOXES

205

winter solstice marked the beginning of year and according to the second tradition
the beginning of the year was with Sun’s passage at spring equinox. At the time of the
Satapatha Brahmana the spring equinox was near the constellation Krttikas (pleiades).42

206 HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY IN INDIA

Later this shifted to Bharani asterism at the time of Surya-prajfapti and to the asterism
Aévini (identified with the star alpha or beta Arieties) in the Siddhantic period.
These days the list of naksatras starts with Agvini. No change was done by the astro-
nomers of the siddhantic period. This is due to the reason that the nirayana (sidereal
i.e, without precession) zodiac got accepted in the tradition, although the Hindu
year was tropical. (This fact will be discussed later), All the later treatises are using
ntrayana longitudes and their respective ayandmsas as the difference between the
analytically computed and observed position of the Sun. It may be noted that from
early Vedic time upto the time of Brahmagupta including Vedaiga Fyotisa, Sirya-
prajitapti, Paica-siddhantika, Aryabhatiya, Brahmasphuta-siddhanta ctc., only the sdyana
(Tropical) longitudes were used. In earlier literature we clearly find change in the
order of naksatras in the zodiac list after an accumulation of precession equal to |
naksatra (=13°20') or more, but now the precession with respect to beginning of
ASvini is about 23°38’ but Ist naksatra of the list has not been changed by any astro-
nomer over about 2000 years. Here in figure 7.5 we have shown the position of spring
or vernal equinox among the stars. Here the Jaina period has been fixed around
200 3.c. taking into consideration the list of naksatras in Sérya-prajfapti. For com-
parison the position of the vernal equinox at the time of Hipparchus (140 B.c.)
too is shown in the diagram. As pointed out earlier in Aryan traditions, the beginning
of the year was taken with Sun’s position at spring equinox or winter solstice, but
after the time of Siérya-prajfapti the vernal equinox position of Asvini was almost
exclusively taken as beginning of year and the winter solstice position got almost
dispensed with in reckoning the beginning of the year.

Although Hipparchus (2nd century B.c.)*4 is accredited with the discovery and
categoric statement of the shift due to precession in the positions of stars with respect
to spring equinox from the time of Timocharis of Alexandria (280 B.c.) yet there is
no doubt that even Vedic Hindus shifted the zero of their zodiac from time to time
and thus, were knowing the phenomenon of precession. Ptolemy (150 a.p.) gave
the velocity of precession to be about 36” per annum which was improved by later
astronomers. In the Indian tradition, although the Ist naksatra in the lists was
changed from time to time, with the changes in the position of spring equinox, the
actual magnitude and rate of precession in the Hindu tradition is not found before
siddhantic period. After the advent of siddhantic (theoretical) astronomy, Visnu-
candra in Vasistha Siddhanta mentions the yuga of ayana (precession) * 46 which gives
the rate of precession as 57” P.A.*® 47 The phenomenon is referred to in Romaka
Siddhanta also*® and it is argued that the shift of solstices among stars is not possible
without precession of equinoxes. These authors were criticised by Brahmagupta,*
Bhaskara 14 (600 a.p.) etc. Varahamihira mentioned the ayana calana hypothesis®
and suggested verifications through actual observations.*! In fact because of small
angle of precession or due to no belief in ayana-calana-hypothesis, the precession was
ignored by Aryabhata, Bhaskara I and Brahmagupta etc. It was Mufijala (10th
century A.D.) who started using ayanémsa which had accumulated to about 6° by that
time. Probably at that time, there was confusion in samkrantis (Solar ingresses or
transits from one sidereal sign to the next) and he had to remove the confusion by
fixing the value of ayandmsa through experimental observations. Visnucandra and

ECLIPSES, PARALLAX AND PRECESSION OF EQUINOXES 207

Muifijala believed in uniform regression of equinoctial point up to complete cycle,
while present Sérya-siddhania uses the hypothesis of oscillatory motion _ (trepidation)
of equinoxes. (This hypothesis will be discussed in details in the next section). The
rate of precession according to Visnucandra is about 56”.9 P.A. (number of cycles
in a kalpa= 189411). According to Mufijala the rate is 59’.2 P.A. (number of cycles
in a kalpa=199669). These are uniform regressional motions. According to Sirya-
siddhanta the cycle of oscillatory motion has a period of 7200 years, but it is strange
that rate of precession is again uniform 54” P.A. and it is not oscillatory which is
against laws of oscillatory motion,

Tue LeNcTH oF SOLAR YEAR, SIDEREAL OR TROPICAL

In Ved/tiga-jyotisa the length of solar year was taken to be 366 days and this was
used in Vedatiga calendar of 5-year yuga having two intercalations in 5 years. Later
in Sarya-siddhanta we find the solar year to be equal to 365 days 15 ghatis 31 palas and
30 vipalas (3654 --6'—12""—245), In fact, methods for determining solar year are
given in Sirya-prajnapti (and Sulba-sittras), At that time there was not known any
distinction between tropical and sidereal years. The Sun was observed while rising
and setting every-day, throughout the year. The length of the year was computed by
counting the number of days and a fraction thereof on the last day at any
of the cardinal points preferably solstices, as the Sun appears to be stationary there.
In diagram 7.6 is given the experimental technique described in Sarya-prajitapti.

At winter solstice Q one starts.observing the Sun while rising in the east with

experiments. The arc PRQ is graduated in 124 divisions and 124 subdivisions in the
fashion of Vedariga astronomical tradition (the figure 124 being the total number of
syzygies in 5 year yuga). P is the summer solstice position of the Sun. At this point the
fraction of the day is computed using ratio proportion and it was estimated that on
the last day it went up to 144 (=124+20) subdivisions (i.e. 20 subdivisions in excess)
and same situation occurred on the winter solstice day on Sun’s back return journey.

2x
This way the length of the year can be shown to be 365 + Tyan

Generally it is believed that Indian astronomers did not determine the length of solar
year experimentally and adopted the value as given in Siirya-siddhanta from external
sources but this decoding of experiment on determination of solar year in
Siryaprajfapti disproves this hypothesis. Such experiments were being performed in
early vedic times too. The earliest report on such observations is found in Aitrareya
Braéhmana.*4 The position of Sun at any point on the horizon of any locality is specified
by its declination, so it is evident that this method will yield tropical year and not
the sidereal year. Thus it is clear that by the word “year” the Hindu astronomers of
pre-siddhantic period meant wopical (sdyana) year. In fact they were not aware of
sidereal (nirayana) year. This very traditional way of determining solar year is found
in the Siddhdnta firomani of Bhaskaracarya and other Siddhantic texts but we do not
find any method of determining really sidereal year in any Siddhantic text of Indian
Astronomy. In fact almost the same was the situation in other traditions of olden
times. It was Piccard who actually determined the sidereal year length by taking
record of right ascensions of Sun at specific times with an interval of 76 sidereal years
(A.D. 1699-1745) 55

= 365) days.

From what has been discussed, it is evident that the Hindus in fact never
intentionally used sidereal year. In all experimental methods (described in Siddhantic
texts) one gets only the tropical year and never sidereal year. This way one can infer
that it was error in the determination of solar year (of the order of 24 minutes in
excess to the actual tropical year)** which was responsible for creating confusion of
taking tropical year for the sidereal year. There is no doubt that this value got into
use in Hindu traditions and now no almanac maker is ready to accept tropical year
for religious Hindu calendar. It is also possible that they intended to use year in
sidereal sense but it happened to be tropical year within the available means they
adopted to measure the “year” in general sense.

Hyporuesis or TREPIDATION OF EQuINOxES

Inspite of the fact that the year length in Indian tradition was intended to be
tropical, the sidereal year got enforced into use unintentionally. The later astronomers
started believing in the hypothesis of trepidation of equinoxes, according to which
the spring equinox oscillates (trepidates) upto --27° on both sides of the fixed zero
of zodiac. It takes about 27000 years to complete this cycle. This way the zero of the
zodiac was thought to get restored twice in each cycle and thus the same was not
changed instead the return was awaited, after it reached 27° from the Asvini naksatra,


ECLIPSES, PARALLAX AND PRECESSION OF EQUINOXES 209

It may be pointed out that Aryabhata II and Paragara believed in-- 24° ampli-
tude of trepidation.5? The rate of precession adopted by Aryabhata II was 46”.5
P.A.°8 It may be remarked that neither Mufijala nor Bhaskaracarya nor others in
Hindu astronomical tradition, have categorically mentioned the oscillation of
equinoxes, Only in the present recension of Sérya-stddhanta, we find a statement®®
which gives the method of computing ayandmsa using throughout a constant velocity
of 54” P.A. In this method, 27° get subtracted adhoc whenever it goes in excess to
this amplitude. This has no mathematical or physical validity (as, unless velocity is
gradually reduced to zero, its direction cannot change).® Moreover, even in Sirya-
siddhanta, the relevant slokas evidently appear to be added later on; as these use a
different style of enumerating figures by actual numbers and not as usual (in all other
parts) by symbols like netra (eyes) =2, candra (Moon) =1, etc. Also in the body of the
text, there is no use of ayandmsa as such in computing /agna (ascendant) etc. There is
just a general statement asking the use of ayandmsa for computing gnomonic shadows,
ascensional differences etc., in that very sloka, where the formula for computing the
same has been given.®!

Even ancient records show that ayandmsa was greater than 27°. For example,
at the time of Satepatha Brahmana when Krttikas are said to rise in the east.5? the
ayanamsa comes out to be 45°. Thus it is not worthwhile to wait for ayandmsa
to accumulate to a value greater than 27° in future, and keep on believing
the hypothesis of trepidation of equinoxes. The law of gravitation has discarded this
hypothesis and explained the phenomenon of full cycle of precession on the basis
of the torque exerted by Sun and Moon on the spheroidal earth.

Brenand® and Vijfianananda Swami* tried to explain the oscillatory motion
of the ayana by taking projections of ecliptic, solstitial colure etc., in one plane, but
such an argument may hold for any value of maximum amplitude of the angle of
precession. In our opinion the oscillations described in Sirya-siddhanta may not
mean more than the declinational north south oscillations of stars on the eastern
horizon due to precession of equinoxes over the period of 27000 years. Thus the
hypothesis of trepidation of equinoxes has no physical validity. On the other hand,
the theory of precession of equinoxes and its full cycle, is the final verdict of the law
of gravitation.

Tue Zero or Hinpu Zoprac AND Various SCHOOLS OF AYANAMSA

As we have pointed out earlier, the zero of the zodiac got fixed at Aévini after
Stryaprajnapti (200 B.c.) when theoretical astronomy started. The various treatises
took their own computed position of the Sun to be exact and defined the ayandmsa
as the difference between its observed and computed positions. Thus the velocity of
ayana was erroneous. The sidereal solar year adopted in Sirya-stddhanta is in excess to
the actual value (determined by Piccard by taking observations over a range of
76 years)** by about 8} palas (=3.6 minutes). Due to this error the analytically
computed celestial sidereal longitude of the Sun will be erroneous and as a
consequence, the sidereal zero of the zodiac is invariably expected to be changed if
one adopts the siddhantic definition of ayanamsa and its velocity. The velocity of

210 HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY IN INDIA

precession according to Sérya-siddhanta is 54” per annum while according to Graha-
laghava it is 60” per annum and other texts have somewhat different velocities. These
velocities include also the errors due to inaccuracies in the measurement of solar year.
As already pointed out, the solar year as determined by the methods described above,
is tropical (sdyana). In fact there is a difference of about 20 minutes between the
sdyana and nirayana years, (nirayana. year being in excess). The methods adopted for
determining the length of year were erroneous to the extent that error of the order
of 20 minutes masked the difference between the two solar years and in fact, because
of no notion of the difference between the two, the tropical year so determined, with
that much error, got adopted as sidereal year and it happened to be in excess (by
about 3.6 minutes) to the actual sidereal year length. As a result of adopting this year
length and Sun’s longitude as eaxct, zero of the zodiac went on shifting from the
actual position and about 3} degrees got accumulated in about 2000 years (since the
time of switch over from Veddrga traditional calendar of 5 year yugas, to the siddhantic
tradition of calendar making). In the last decades of 19th century a.p. traditional
paiicanga-makers were trying to fix the zero of Hindu zodiac by adopting the modern
value for precessional velocity or by back calculating the position of spring equinox
in conformity with the data of Sirya-siddhanta or other standard treatises of Indian
tradition. Since the polar longitudes of stars etc. given in Sarya-siddhanta can not yield
a consistent ayandmsa, the problem of ayandmsa remained a vexed question. There
were many rival publications by Govinda Sada Siva Apte and Dina Natha Shastri
Chulet and many others.$? These conflicts gave rise to two different prominent
schools Raivata paksa and Citra paksa among the followers of the modern school
(called the Drk-paksa, the school believing in observations). The third one being the
Surya-siddhanta school which has erroneous rate of precession. According to the
Raivata paksa the ayandmsa is about 34 degrees less than the value in the Citra school.
If the zero of zodiac is defined as the position of spring equinox at the time of switch
over from the Vedanga to siddhantic tradition of pafcdriga-making, the Raivata
paksa has sound justification, because if year length had 8} palas error, the same
must have been accumulated. According to the exponents of Citra school the zero
is 180° away from Ist magnitude star Spica or a-Virginis (Citr). In fact the authors
of various treatises over the past 1500 years too, did try to fix the zero of Hindu zodiac
from time to time. Zeros of the zodiac are different in various treatises as tabulated
below. ®

*It is interesting to note that one of the manuscripts of Rdjamrgdnka has no ayandméa

indicates that ayandmsa took long time to get into common use,

ECLIPSES, PARALLAX AND PRECESSION OF EQUINOXES 211

It is clear that there were attempts to fix the zero of the zodiac to dates before
Aryabhata.

Note that changes in zero of zodiac were done upto the time of
Grahaléghava (16th century a.p.). Thus there were quite different years of
zero ayandmfa as shown in the table above. Indian Calendar Reform
Committee” under the Chairmanship of late Prof. M. N. Saha, analyzed
the problem using polar longitudes of stars given in the Siirya-siddhanta and
concluded that the zero was being fixed again and again by different Jyotisacaryas
in their own times. There exists difference upto over 3° or so in different treatises
of astronomy, but certainly the zero of Hindu zodiac is about 2° removed
from that of Ptolemy’s. From this analysis it is clear that it is not the zero of the
Vedanga zodiac which we have in modern Sarya-siddhanta. Thus not going by any
old text, the followers of Citra paksa fixed the zero at that very point to which the
equinox had shifted upto 1800 Saka or so (as used by V. B. Ketakara)?1 and adopted
the accurate value of precessional velocity so that no more error is accumulated in
future years, A fact has to be stated that previously V. B. Ketakara too published
Jpotirganitam using Raivata paksiya ayanamsa, but on the advice of Sankara Bala Krishna
Dixit, he destroyed all copies of the same and rewrote and published the Citra paksiya
Jyotirganitam. He even deleted a sloka?? (on the advice of S. B. Dixit) in which he had
clarified that it was the Raivata Paksa which was justified but because of its un-
acceptability in the social practices he started Citré Paksa which would go parallel
to Siirya-siddhania for a century or so and thus get adopted by that time. The Calendar
Reform Committee has advised to fix the ayandmsa at 23°15’ (a value for Jan. 0,1955
A.D.) and started taking most accurate expressions for precessional velocity and also
the nutation. The Committee proposed a Sayana Saka year beginning with 2lst
March (22nd March in case of leap year) but it could not be accepted by traditional
paficaiga makers. The zero of zodiac in this system is moving with same velocity as
that of precession but it will always be at a constant distance of 23°15’ from the
position of spring equinox. For defining lunar months it will be a good plan if the
constant precession 23°15’ is used without further change with the precessional
velocity.7® This way the lunar months will be defined with respect to sdyana longitude
of the Sun minus 23°15’ at the ending moment of respective amévdsyds. This way,
the change in the limits of lunar months with respect to tropical calendar
(say Gregorian Calendar) accumulated up to 1955 a.p., will not increase any more in
years to come. Consequently the lunar months will get pegged on to sayana solar year
and this change may not be noted by ordinary people to result in disorders in social
practices, This way the luni-solar religious calendar will conform to seasons at least
to the extent it was in 1955 a.p. But this technique cannot be accepted unless it gets
the sanction of Hindu religious authorities. Since the names of lunar months are
conforming to the asterisms occupied by the Moon at the ending moments
of full-moon syzygies and many festivals are related with asterisms, the pajicdiga
makers find it difficult to adopt the constant precession system for deciding religious
rites, This is the reason why the proposals of the Calendar Reform Committee did
not receive recognition and in near future there is no hope to switch over to sdyana
system or constant precession system of calendar-making for Hindu religious rites,

A RATIONALE OF BHATTA GOVINDA’S METHOD FOR SOLVING

OF THE DETERMINATION OF ‘MATI’ AS GIVEN

(Received 27 August 1980)

Indian scholar Bhatta Govinda (c, 850) perhaps used the method of continued
fraction to find out the integral solution of the indeterminate equation of the
type ax—c=hy, i.e. Bhatya Govinda perhaps used the tool prgn—1—GaPn—1
=(—1)° of the continued fraction for the solution of the indeterminate equa-
tion of the type ax—c-==by. The paper presents the original Sanskrit verses (in
Roman character) from Bhatta Govinda’s Work, its English translation with
modern interpretation, Lastly, we have considered a comparative study of the
determination of Mati as given by Bhaskara and Bhatta Govinda.

INTRODUCTION

Bag? and Majumdar? discussed the method of integral solution of indeterminate
equation of the type by =ax-kc in ancient and medieval India. But they never went
through the detailed study of Bhatta Govinda’s method for obtaining general solution
of linear indeterminate equation of the type by =ax—c. In this paper it is shown that
the method given by Bhatta Govinda is slightly different from that of BhaskaraI though
Bhatta Govinda took the same equation ax—c=by where a<b, i.e. after showing
the result DnQn-1—QnPn—-1 =(— 1)"" of the continued fraction was implicitly involved in
the method of solution of the equation by =ax-—-c and then a comparative study of
the determination of ‘Mati’ as given by Bhaskara I and Bhafta Govinda.

Shukla® translates these verses as follows:

Set down the dividend and underneath that (dividend set down) the divisor and
then perform their mutual division. Write down the quotients (of mutual division)
one below the other, the second one under the first, the third one under the second
and so on. Carry on the mutual division till the (reduced) dividend and the (reduced)
divisor are different from zero. If the number of quotients (thus obtained) is even,
obtain the (number called) ‘mati’ in accordance with the (following) rule, and if
the number of quotients is odd, obtain the ‘mati’ contrarily.

When the interpolator is negative, divide the interpolator by the (reduced) dividend,
then subtract the resulting remainder from the (reduced) dividend, then multiply the
remainder obtained by the (reduced) divisor, then increase the resulting product by
the interpolator, and then divide the resulting sum by the (reduced) dividend the quo-
tient (obtained) is the ‘mati’.

When the interpolator is positive, diminish the (reduced) divisor by one (rupona-
hara), by that multiply the interpolator, divide that by the (reduced) dividend then
divide the (resulting) quotient by the (reduced) divisor, the remainder (obtained) is
the ‘mati’. In case the remainder is zero, then the divisor itself is the ‘mati’.

Multiply the (reduced) dividend by the ‘mati’, then subtract the gata (i.e. negative
interpolator) from or add the gantavya (i.e. positive interpolator) to that (product)
and then divide the (difference or sum) by the (reduced) divisor. Write down the ‘mati’
under the chain (of quotients) and underneath that (‘mati’) write down the quotient
(obtained) also.

By the penultimate number (of the chain of quotients) multiply the upper number
and (to the product) add the last (i.e. lower most) number. (After doing this rub out

202 PRADIP KUMAR MAJUMDAR

the last number). Repeat this process again and again until there ate left only two
numbers in the chain.

(Of these two numbers) divide the upper number by the divisor and the lower
number by the dividend (if it is possible). The remainders (obtained) denote (respec-
tively) the days, etc. and the revolutions etc. which are the requisite quantities.

3. RATIONALE OF THE RULE

The equation is of the type ax—c=by ....(1) where a=dividend, b=divisor, and
remember a<b. Now according to the meaning of the verses, we have

4, DISSIMILARITIES

Bhiaskara I and Bhatta Govinda discussed the method of solution of the same
equation, viz. by=ax—c where a<b and their method of solution is nearly the same.
The only difference is in the determination of ‘mati’ for the method of solution of the
equation by=ax—c.

Now let us determine ‘mati’ as found by Bhaskara I. Bhaskara I said’ “..... Now

ON MATHEMATICAL COMPLEXITY OF ŚRĪYANTRA
VLADISLAV-VENIAMIN PUSTYNSKI*
(Received 13 August 2013)
Abstract
Śrīyantra is an ancient geometrical construction based on interlocking triangles. As other ancient
yantras, it is of large importance for meditation. Empirical methods widely used for Śrīyantra construction
are adequate only for small shapes drawn with wide lines. High accuracy required for large shapes may
be achieved using the mathematical solution based on geometrical properties of Śrīyantra. In this work
we show how accurate parameters of Śrīyantra may be obtained algebraically. We study uniqueness of
the solution and discuss mathematical and computational complexity of the problem.
Key words: Algebraic fractions, Non-linear equations, Numerical solutions, Śrīyantra

1. INTRODUCTION
Śrīyantra, also known as Śrīcakra, is an
ancient sacred diagram widely used in Tāntric
meditation practices, as well as a decorative
element and an architectural form (Kulaichev &
Ramendic, 1989). The central region of Śrīyantra
represents a network of nine interlocking primary
triangles inscribed into a circle. The five triangles
pointing down represent Śakti, the female
principle, and the four triangles pointing up
represent Śiva, the male principle. The central
point of the figure, Bindu, is common for all the
triangles, it unifies both principles (Huet, 2002;
Rao,1998). Intersection points of the triangles
generate secondary triangles, 43 of which
(arranged in four nested complexes of 14, 10, 10,
8 triangles respectively plus the central triangle)
are traditionally colored. The complex of triangles
is encircled with an 8-petalled lotus, surrounded
by another circle and a 16-petalled lotus. The outer
lotus lies inside a triplet of concentric circles. The
whole figure is placed into a square formed by
three lines and provided with four gateways, see
Fig. 1. Three main types of Śrīyantra are known:
the plain shape, the spherical shape and the stepped
shape. A good overview of the spiritual meaning
of Śrīyantra and its components is given in (Rao,
1998). We note that traditional literature does not
contain constraints necessary and sufficient to
define a unique representation of Śrīyantra. It was
shown in (Huet, 2002; Rao,1998) that an unlimited
number of figures satisfy the general specifications
that may be found in classical literature.
Rao (1998) expressed algebraically
correlations between parameters of Śrīyantra and
specified 20 possible constraints to these
parameters. He also found numerical solutions for
a number of combinations of these constraints,
both for spherical and plane shapes. The problem
of mathematical complexity of Śrīyantra was
studied by Kulaichev (1984). He analyzed one of
possible plain Śrīyantra forms (corresponding to
the 6th set of constraints in (Rao, 1998, Table 1),
namely the variant with 10 vertices of the primary
triangles lying on the circumscribing circle. This
form is illustrated in Fig. 1 taken from (Kulaichev,
1984). The method of drawing Śrīyantra was
presented as a four-step iterative process.
Kulaichev found that the problem may be reduced
to a system of four algebraic non-linear equationsON MATHEMATICAL COMPLEXITY OF ŚRĪYANTRA
269
with up to sixteenth power of variables. He found
a numerical solution (his results coincided with
the solution of Rao) and raised the question of
uniqueness of this solution. Following Kulaichev,
the system of four equations may be reduced to a
polynomial of a single variable with a power not
higher than 12544. Kulaichev concludes that the
problem of uniqueness far exceeded the capacities
of computers of that time. His conclusions of an
extreme geometrical and computational
complexity of Śrīyantra were widely cited (see
for instance Tularam 2012 and The Hindu News,
Nov. 25, 1984).
In this work we discuss in more detail
some of Kulaichev’s conclusions. We deduce all
equations necessary to construct Śrīyantra and
formulate these equations in terms of coordinates
of the significant points. We demonstrate that
iterative procedures may be replaced by analytical
solutions in the first two steps. The systems of
equations on the third and the forth step are quite
unwieldy for analytical solution and should be
solved using approximative root-finding methods.
Therefore, all parameters of Śrīyantra may be
found by a two-step iterative procedure. We study
the equations numerically (and, where possible,
analytically) and conclude that each of the steps
has only one significant root. This means that only
one Śrīyantra may be constructed with the
restrictions adopted in (Kulaichev1984). We prove
that convergence of iterative processes is relatively
fast; this fact simplifies the procedure of finding
the solution algebraically or graphically. The
deduced set of equations may be used with some
modifications to solve other possible forms of
Śrīyantra.
2. CONSTRUCTION STEPS AND ANALYSIS
To construct Śrīyantra, we follow the four-
steps procedure described in (Kulaichev1984). In
each step we derive necessary equations and
analyze them. We draw Śrīyantra step by step
inside a circle with a unit radius. Only the right
half of the circle is shown in the figures for more
clarity. Points below the horizontal line of
symmetry are labeled with primed letters.

circumscribing circle.
Fig. 2. The first step. The intersection point B’ of the
segments βζ’ and Dη’ lies on the segment D’α’.270
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
2.1 First step
On this step the two largest of the nine
primary triangles and the primary triangle with
the lowermost horizontal base is drawn. We
arbitrarily choose y-coordinate of the point D, i.e.
the value Dy (0 < Dy < 1), see Fig. 2. This value
should be refined on the forth step. We draw
symmetrical congruent triangles DαV′ and D′α′V,
they will be the largest primary triangles.
Let’s calculate x-coordinates of the points
α and β together with their counterparts (α′ and
β′ ). We will need these coordinates later. It is
obvious that αx = 
. From the
triangles D′α′V and DβV it is also obvious that
 , so 
.
We shall find now the point ζ′. The
segment ζ′η′ should be horizontal and the
segments Dη′, βζ′ should intersect in the point B′
lying on the segment D′α′. From the triangles Dβζ′
and D′β′ζ′ we find 
 (we take into
account that y-coordinates below x-axis are
negative), from the triangles Dη′ζ′ and DD′B′ we
find 
. Since the point η′ lies on the
circumscribing circle and ζ′η′ is horizontal,
. These tree equations may be
combined into a single equation
…(1)
where βx depends only on Dy. Therefore, the
formula (1) represents an equation for ζ′y in terms
of Dy. When squared, it becomes a quadratic
equation and may be solved analytically. After
some transformations, the following formula for
the negative root may be obtained:
.
…(2)
The second root differs by the
negative sign before 2 in numerator and is
positive for every Dy; this is obvious since
. A positive
value of ζ′y is meaningless for Śrīyantra.
2.2 Second step
On the second step we draw the primary
triangle with the uppermost horizontal base. An
arbitrary point A′ is chosen on the segment OD′
(0 < – A′y <Dy). Its y-coordinate A′y is the parameter
to be refined on the third step. This point is used
for a construction similar to one drawn on the first
step, see Fig. 3: the point δ of intersection of A′ε
and β′γ should lie on the segment Dα, and γε
should be horizontal.
Fig. 3. The second step. The intersection point δ of the
segments β′γ and A′ε lies on the segment Dα.
From the triangles D′β′γ and Dβγ we find
that 
 (using the fact that D′y = – Dy),ON MATHEMATICAL COMPLEXITY OF ŚRĪYANTRA
271
from the triangles A′εγ and A′Dδ we get
. Since the point ε lies on the
circumscribing circle and γε is horizontal,
. These tree equations may be
combined into a single equation
,
…(3)
where βx depends only on Dy. Therefore the
formula (3) represents an equation for γy expressed
in terms of Dy and A′y. When squared, it becomes
a quartic equation with respect to γy:
…(4)
where a, b, c, d and e are the following functions
of Dy and A′y:
decreases to zero and becomes negative; at some
point it becomes smaller than –Dy. When the
denominator of Eq. (6) approaches zero, f
approaches –∞ from the left and to +∞ from the
right. With further growth of γy, f drops to unity:
f(1) = 1. For γy > 1 only complex values of A′y
exist. Fig. 4 illustrates the behavior of the function
A′y = f (γy) for three different values of the
parameter Dy. It is seen that A′y is a one-to-one
function of γy, and this is true for each value of Dy.
Therefore the opposite is also true: there is only
one positive value of γy that corresponds to each
negative value of A′y. This fact proves the
uniqueness of the positive root of Eq. (4). Of
course, this equation has also at least one negative
root (and sometimes may have two or three
negative roots), but negative roots are meaningless
for Śrīyantra.
Thus it has been proven that the first two
steps have unique analytical solutions. However,
since analytical solution of quartic equations
requires many operations, one may prefer to solve
the second step numerically, as it is frequently
done in practice with quartic equations. In this case
we recommend to solve directly Eq. (3) as it is
relatively simple.
2.3 Third step
The third step is based on intersection
points obtained on the first and the second steps.

parameter Dy.
…(5)
Since quartic equations may be solved
analytically, the second step of Śrīyantra also has
an analytical solution. However, quartic equations
may have up to four real roots, and the question
of the number of roots of Eq. (4) in the range
(–Dy, 0) should be studied. It may be more simple
to return to Eq. (3) and to express A′y as a function
of γy:
.
…(6)
Eq. (6) was studied numerically. A′y versus γy was
plotted in the range (Dy, 1) for different values of
Dy (we used a dense grid of 10 000 points for γy).
It was found that the function A′y = f (γy) has similar
appearance for all values of Dy. Its behavior is the
following: Dy = f (Dy); when γy increases, f272

of three segments.
Fig. 6. The forth step. The central circle is inscribed into
the triangle A′χω.
We complete the two primary triangles that we
started in the first two steps and add two inner
primary triangles (see Fig. 5). On this step the
parameter A′y (chosen freely on the 2nd step)
becomes fixed by the value of the parameter Dy,
i.e. it becomes a function of Dy.
On this step it is convenient to find
coordinates of intersection points of segments
using equations of lines corresponding to these
segments. Let’s start with the point θ′ lying in the
intersection of the segments V′α and Dη′. The
equation of the line V′α is 
 and the
equation of the line Dη′ is 
.
The point θ′ belongs to both lines, so we get its
coordinates solving the system of the two
equations. The result is:
     …(7)
Other intersections are found in a similar
way. λ lies in the intersection of the segments Vα′
and A′ε, so from the equations of these two lines
we get
 
…(8)
Next we find the point ζ′ where the
horizontal line crossing the point A′ touches the
segment ζ′v:
…(9)
The point ρ is the intersection point of A′ε
and µζ′ (we use the fact that µy = λy):
  
These equations may be simplified using
Eq. (8):ON MATHEMATICAL COMPLEXITY OF ŚRĪYANTRA
273
…(10)
The point ρ defines the point τ on the
horizontal segment passing through ρ and
touching the segment λκ′ (i.e. on the segment στ):
.
…(11)
The final and the key point of this
construction is ϕ′. We may look for two points:
the point ϕ′1 where the segment Dη′ intersects with
the horizontal segment A′ζ′, and the point  ϕ′2
where the segment ι′τ  intersects with A′ζ′. The
line equations give:
 
 
.
…(12)
If the point A′ is arbitrary, ϕ′1 and ϕ′2 do not
coincide in the general case. But in accurately
drawn Śrīyantra they coincide in a single point
ϕ′. Thus A′y should be chosen in a way that the
condition ϕ′1x = ϕ′2x is satisfied, i.e.
…(13)
The Eqs. (7 – 11, 13) together with the
equations 
 
 form a system. Theoretically it is
possible to reduce this system to a singe relation
between the parameters Dy and A′y. Unfortunately,
such a relation would be very unwieldy and it
would be impossible to find A′y as an analytical
function of Dy.
However, the above-mentioned system of
equations may be analyzed numerically. We
performed this analysis sequentially substituting
coordinates from the earlier equations into the
Eq. (13) and studying numerically the trend of the
difference φ1x – φ2x as a function of A′y. We plotted
this difference against A′y using a dense grid of
A′y values (the range of A′y was divided into 10 000
points). It was found that ϕ′1x – ϕ′2x is a uniformly
decreasing function for all values of Dy. In Fig. 7
this function is plotted for three values of Dy (the
trends are increasing since – A′y values are depicted
for convenience in the x-axis). There is no sign of
local extrema on the graphs, and, considering the
high density of the grid, there is evidently no
chance that local extrema could have been missed.
Thus we may conclude that the third step has a
unique solution. Further study shows that ϕ1x –
ϕ2x has an infinite discontinuity at the point–1:
 and 
. A second
root is present in the domain A′y < –1, more roots
may appear in the domain A′y > 0; however, these
roots are meaningless for Śrīyantra.
Since the formulae used in this step are
quite simple by their nature (algebraic fractions),
it takes very little computational time to find the
root of Eq. (13) even with the simplest numerical
methods (i.e. with the secant method). It is
important since this this root is used as an
intermediate result on the forth step and should
be calculated many times while seeking for Dy,
see Section 2.4. To conclude this section, we give
the formulae for the points ν and κ′ (these points
are vertices of two primary triangles, see Fig. 5):

different values of Dy. All graphs are plotted in the range
(0 – Dy).274

…(14)
2.4 Forth step
On the forth step the ninth (i.e. the
smallest) of the primary triangles is drawn, and
the construction of Śrīyantra is completed. On this
step the value of the parameter Dy (chosen freely
on the first step) becomes fixed, and the whole
construction finally becomes rigid.
First we will need the point χ, that is the
intersection point of the segments Dη′ and A′yε.
Using the equations of the corresponding lines,
we find from the condition of their intersection:
…(15)
Next we find a point ψ where the segment
ωχ touches the segment µζ′. (Please note that the
point ψ is not the intersection point of the segments
ι′τ and µξ′, although in the final construction χ
will lie very close to this point). The coordinates
of ψ are:
.
…(16)
The final detail of the construction is the
circle inscribed into the innermost triangle ωχΑ′:
this circle should be concentric with the
circumscribing circle of Śrīyantra. Let’s formulate
this condition algebraically. The radius of the
innermost circle is R = χy. The distance from the
central point to the segment A′ε should be the
same. The well-known formula for the distance
from a point to a line gives 
, so
we finally get:
.
…(17)
The condition (17) is satisfied only for a
specific value of Dy. Since it is impossible to find
A′y analytically on the third step, we are obliged
to rely again on numerical methods and to solve
Eq. (17) iteratively. At each step of the iteration it
is necessary to repeat the steps 1–3.
Fig. 8. Difference χy – R as a function of Dy.
Since our task is not only to obtain the
solution of Śrīyantra, but also to study uniqueness
of this solution, we investigated Eq. (17)
numerically. The left-hand side of Eq. (17) was
plotted as a function of Dy in the range (0, 1) (a
dense grid of 10 000 values of Dy was used). The
resulting trend is represented in Fig. 8. Numerical
analysis shows that the trend has a singularity at
the point Dy = 0. This point corresponds to the
degenerate case, when the segments Dα and D′α
(and consequently the whole construction) merge
together. Of course this point is meaningless for
the actual Śrīyantra. It may be concluded from
Fig. 8 that Eq. (17) has a single root in the range
0.25 < Dy < 0.30. This proves that Śrīyantra with
restrictions set in (4) has a unique solution.
2.5 Results
Eq. (17) was solved numerically. The
Table 1 contains coordinates of all points shown
in Fig. 6 (with exception of symmetrical points
D′, α′ and β′). The values of γy, ζ′y, A′y and Dy (i.e.
the parameters calculated on the steps 1 – 4) are
put in bold. 15 figures are given for each
coordinate, at least 14 of them are significant. OurON MATHEMATICAL COMPLEXITY OF ŚRĪYANTRA

results coincide with the results by (Rao 1998)
(where 6 significant figures are given) and are
slightly more accurate then the values in

first 10 of them are correct). As it has been
demonstrated, Śrīyantra does not have alternative
solutions.
based software by SOURCEFORGE, which was
also used to construct Śrīyantra in vector format.
Although a two-step iteration was required, an
ordinary PC was able to find the solution and to
build the plot within seconds.
3. DISCUSSION
It was found that all parameters of
Śrīyantra with the constraints adopted
in (Kulaichev, 1984) and in (Rao, 1998) may be
found via a two-step iteration procedure. The first
two steps have analytical solutions. Analytical and
numerical analysis shows that each of the four
steps has a unique root. Therefore we conclude
that there is only one set of parameters satisfying
the adopted constraints. Unfortunately, purely
analytical solution of the final two steps is
probably impossible since the corresponding
equations are too unwieldy.
As it was mentioned in Section 1, the
analyzed variant is only one of many possible
representations of Śrīyantra. However we consider
this variant to be important by two reasons.
1) First, in this variant ten vertices of four
primary triangles belong to the circumscribing
circle, while in other representations the number
of such vertices is only six, and only two primary
triangles are in contact with the circle. This feature
makes the figure visually more complex.
Kulaichev (1984) hypothesizes that this form is
the basic representation of Śrīyantra, other forms
being its simplifications. If we reject the above-
mentioned constraint without adding other
restrictions, Śrīyantra will not be a rigid figure
anymore, and it will be possible to continuously
deform it; so its drawing will be simplified to a
large extent. Kulaichev notices that although
simplified figures are more common, most of them
are not so old as the studied variant, the earliest
representations of which may be dated not later
than 17 century AD.

It is interesting to note that the intersection
point of the segments µξ′ and ι′τ is very close to
the point ψ. It’s x-coordinate is only ≈ 4.0 × 10-4
smaller than ψx and its y-coordinate is only ≈ 6.5
× 10-4 larger than ψy. Since this point lies to the
upper left of ψ, the segments D′ψ and ι′τ also
intersect within close proximity to ψ, and two
additional tiny triangles are formed.

2) Most of the variants studied by (Rao,
1998) are defined by 5 constraints (see the next
paragraph). The variant we studied is apparently
based only on 4 constraints. The reason is that
there is an additional “superconstraint” in this
variant, namely, the two largest primary triangles
are congruent, so Dy = – D′y. This feature gives
more symmetry to the figure and makes its
geometry more restricted in comparison with other
forms.
Although other Śrīyantra variants are
possible, some of our results may be directly
applied to other representations. For instance, the
analytical solutions of the first and the seconds
steps remain unchanged for each variant with
congruent primary triangles DαV′ and D′α′V and
the points ε, η′ lying on the circumscribing circle.
Most of the derived equations may remain
unaltered even if some constraints are replaced
with other ones: these equations are algebraic
manifestations of line intersections and they keep
until the corresponding lines intersect. Of course,
if some equations are altered, a new solution of
the whole figure should be found and the problem
of uniqueness of that solution should be studied
again. If additional free parameters are introduced,
more steps should be added to the procedure of
solution. Rao (1998) uses five parameters b, c, d,
e, g; they are related to our parameters γy, ζ′y, A′y
and Dy in the following way: b = – (Dy + ζ′y), c =
–D′y, d = Dy, e = γy – Dy and g = – A′y. If we cancel
the restriction that the triangles DαV’ and D′α′V
are congruent, the equality Dy = – D′y will vanish
and a fifth free parameter will appear. Canceling
one restriction would imply a need to introduce
another restriction to keep Śrīyantra rigid.
It is relatively easy to solve and analyze
Śrīyantra equations numerically since they have
a sufficiently simple form of algebraic fractions.
The simplest numerical algorithms (bisection
method and secant method) are adequate to find
approximate roots with a high degree of accuracy.
Even massive calculations required to make Fig. 8
were performed on an ordinary PC in less than
ten seconds.
It remains questionable, though, if it was
possible to find an accurate solution of Śrīyantra
in pre-computer era. Algebraic solution of
Śrīyantra does not require a lot of mathematical
knowledge. In principle, it is enough to be able to
calculate fractions, square roots and to know some
approximative root-finding method. Theoretically,
a more or less accurate solution could have been
found centuries ago: methods of finding quadratic
roots were known to Indian mathematicians at
least from the times of Śulba-Śūtras, and
Brahmagupta was the first who gave an explicit
method to solve quadratic equations (Colebrooke,
1817). Approximative calculations were also
known since ancient times. However, technically
the procedure of finding the solution probably was
too complicated for ancient mathematicians, since
the total amount of calculations is really large.
Nevertheless we would like to stress that computer
is not required to get a sufficiently accurate result.
Using for computations only a pocket calculator,
we were able to get the parameters of Śrīyantra in
several days with an accuracy better than 0.01%.
It may be explained by the fact that discrepancies
in intersection points grow slowly when
parameters diverge from their exact values. Fig. 7
shows that discrepancy in the point ϕ grows ~2
times slower than A′y, and Fig. 8 shows that
discrepancy between χy and R grows only by about
0.01 ÷ 0.02 when Dy differs by 0.1 from its exact
value. Such a slow growth of discrepancy leads
to quick convergence of root-finding iterative
procedures. Of course, it also helps to find the
solution geometrically, adjusting the drawing
manually step-by-step and fixing the best result
with the aid of algebraic proportions between the
parameters of the best fit. Therefore, obviouslyON MATHEMATICAL COMPLEXITY OF ŚRĪYANTRA
277
Śrīyantra may be drawn with sufficient accuracy
by manual iterations in reasonable time.

This book deals with history of important and very significant Indian
contributions to advanced mathematics during the 14th and 15th centuries originating
in what is now Kerala, India and the direct transmission of this knowledge to
Europe through Portuguese traders and Christian missionaries in the 16th century.
The book’s primary focus is on approximately the time period from when Vasco
da Gama (1460-1524), the first European (Portuguese) explorer, came (1498) to
India and the year the Queen Elizabeth-I (1533-1603) of Great Britain signed
(31st December, 1600) the charter for the East India Company which was formed
initially for exploratory trade but eventually came to conquer and rule India.
This 477 page book has nine chapters organized in four parts. In the first
part containing two chapters, the author dealt with the nature of mathematical
proof with references to Hilbert (1862-1943) and Euclid (ca. 325 BC – ca. 270
BC) of Europe contrasting with the differing but much deeper thoughts of the
Hindu civilization in India that created the revolutionary concept of ‘sƒu–nya’ or
zero, the pivotal concept in the decimal positional number system that conquered
Europe. The second part containing three chapters dealt with research and
development works on advanced mathematics in India and the underlying practical
needs that motivated this creative advancement. This is the most important part
of this book. Chapter 3 deals with the infinite power series expansion of
trigonometric functions and their inverses that originated in India in the fourteenth
century onwards along with the associated conceptual and philosophical
underpinnings.160
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
Chapter 4 dealt with the needs for accurate computations of trigonometric
functions arising out of necessity for reliable and accurate determinations of various
terrestrial parameters (time, latitudes, longitudes, radius of the earth etc.) and
dynamics of celestial bodies. Chapter 5 dealt with applications of this advanced
mathematics in the creation of accurate navigational techniques for commercial
applications in voyages through high seas. A remarkable application of this was
demonstrated to stunned Vasco da Gama in 1498 when he learnt it first hand from
an expert Indian Navigator, who accurately guided him to cross the equator in a
perfect voyage through the mighty Indian Ocean to arrive at Calicut (11.250 N,
75.770 E), on May 25, 1498 in Kerala, India from Malindi (3.2236110 S,
40.1299440 E), Kenya.
The third part containing three chapters dealt with the transmission of
knowledge of advanced mathematics to Europe in the sixteenth century that
originated in India during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Chapter 6 dealt
with the circumstances and evidentiary considerations surrounding this assertion of
direct propagation of advanced mathematics from the East to the West. Chapter
7 discussed the very hungry practical needs for advanced mathematical calculations
required in accurate navigation through high seas that existed in Europe in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and beyond. Chapter 8 dealt with advanced
philosophical concepts that were behind the Hindu civilization’s invention of the
zero (sƒu–nya) and the following development of advanced mathematics that formed
the foundation of numerical and computational mathematics in this digital age. The
fourth part contains a chapter and an appendix dealing with the author’s perception
of differences in understanding and practices of mathematics, roles of empirical,
formal and intuitive approaches, characteristic of the two distant civilizations,
Indian and European.
Glorious contributions of the Hindu civilization in India towards advancement
of science and technology on the world stage need to be studied, appreciated and
correctly narrated to the world by its able descendants for education and enrichment
of the minds of all — present and future. The author has taken this solemn
responsibility to study and candidly present in this book an important documented
contribution from India in the field of advanced mathematics and its direct
transmission to Europe during the sixteenth century AD. This later contribution has
its logical foundation in the positional decimal number system with the zero — the

and recognized all over the world. Special appreciation must be accorded to the
General Editor Prof. D. P. Chattopadhyaya for allowing Prof. Raju the freedom
to express his thoughts freely.  All citizens of India, present and future should be
grateful to Professor Chandra Kant Raju for undertaking this solemn task.
Diffusion of knowledge is a fundamental natural process continuously in
action through all times in human history. The speed at which this action gets
transmitted in space from one place to another depends on many factors. These
include the medium of transmission, distance involved, practical importance of the
knowledge and the social, economic and political conditions in existence along the
various paths. In the history of European civilizations there are two important
dates which are very relevant to this discussion. The first one is the Fall of Rome
on 14th September 476 AD when Odoacer (435-493), the barbarian, threw out
Western Roman Emperor Romulus Augustus and became the German King of
Italy plunging Europe into the Dark Age (Great Indian mathematician A
– ryabhat.a
was born in India, the same year, 476 AD). The other one is the Fall of
Constantinople on 29th May 1453 designating the fall of the Eastern Roman
Empire to the Ottoman Turks. There were no scientific and mathematical works
worth mentioning that originated in Europe during this long 977 years. In fact,
there were no contributions worth mentioning towards advancement of science
and technology in Europe since Claudius Ptolemy (90 AD - 168 AD) until Nicholaus
Copernicus (1473 AD – 1543 AD) and Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519). In
order to cover up this embarrassing situation, some unscrupulous western historians
of science and technology have and remain engaged in deliberate omission, distortion
and outright falsehood in portraying the imported contributions of other advanced
civilizations to bridge this long thirteen hundred years gap between Ptolemy and
Copernicus.
The Dark ages continued for many centuries since the fall of Rome through
1202 when Leonardo of Pisa (more commonly known as Fibonacci) published
his famous book Liber Abaci, and went beyond into the fifteenth Century AD.
Leonardo of Pisa or Leonardo Pisano was born in Italy around 1175 AD.
Son of Mr. Guglielmo Bonachi, Leonardo Pisano studied the vastly superior Indo-
Arabic arithmatics used by Arab traders in international commerce in North Africa
around the Mediterranean. Fibonacci wrote the book, Liber Abaci, in 1202 on
Hindu arithmatics based on decimal positional number system with zero as the
tenth digit, invented in India and showed its (‘Modus Indorum’) vast superiority162
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
over the Roman number system, then still in use in many parts of Europe. Publication
of Fibonacci’s book is the definitive event that made this immortal invention of
India in computational mathematics to establish the foundation for later
advancements in mathematics in Europe including the contributions of Isaac Newton
(1642-1727) and Leibniz (1646-1716) in the development of infinitesimal calculus.
Soon after its publication, this definitive book Liber Abaci by Fibonacci
was widely circulated and read in Europe. The book described in details the
superiority of the Hindu system of arithmetic calculations, based on the positional
decimal number system with zero as the tenth digit, for day to day personal and
commercial applications. Originally written in Latin, Liber Abaci has recently
been translated into English by Laurence Sigler (Springer-Verlag, 2002, ISBN 0-
387-40737-5). Since Europe, in the early thirteenth century, was still passing
through the long lasting Dark Ages, it had taken several centuries for the ‘Modus
Indorum’ to take a firm foothold there. It is through this definitive book of 1202
by Fibonacci that the greatest contribution of the Hindu civilization of India
conquered Europe and the world. Prior to Fibonacci’s book, Brahmagupta’s
(598-668) book on Hindu mathematics, the Bra–hmasphut.asiddha–nta appeared
in Europe to limited number of scholars in 1126 in Latin, translated from the
Arabic version, which was first translated by Middle East scholar Muhammad
(ibn Ibrahim) al-Fazari (ca.735 – ca.806) from the original Sanskrit. It is eminently
puzzling that Professor Chandra Kant Raju who has studied history of mathematics
for at least a decade and himself a professional of eminence in the area of
mathematics and computer science in India has failed to mention Fibonacci and
his contributions correctly in this book. It is this failure that prevented Professor
Raju from assuming the mantle and the tone of a conqueror to narrate the rest of
the story and this is the fundamental weakness of this book and significantly
diminishes its scholastic value.
It followed naturally then, that European scholars would be interested in
further advanced developments of mathematics in India, useful for commercial and
scholarly applications. Later works of advanced mathematics originally done in
the Sanskrit language got translated into Latin, either directly or via the Arabic
language, diffused into Europe and came into the hands of scholars who in those
days were simultaneously involved in theology as well as in natural and physical
sciences. A subject matter scholar primarily deals with the acquisition, assimilation
and propagation of new knowledge and must not be automatically assumed to be163
BOOK REVIEW: CULTURAL FOUNDATION OF MATHEMATICS
interested in or knowledgeable about the true history of the subject. This is
especially true when the acquired knowledge is from a distant civilization. Once
the superiority and usefulness of the Hindu number system had been appreciated
and established in Europe by the end of the fifteenth century, it followed naturally
that further developments of advance knowledge in mathematics and astronomy
originating in India will diffuse into Europe.
Indian mathematics scholar Ma–dhava of San.gamagra–ma (1350-1425)
created power series expansion techniques for accurate computations of
trigonometric functions and their inverses for applications in astronomy and
navigation. That knowledge must have gotten transmitted into Europe to various
scholars including Vincenzo Viviani (1622-1703) and Stefano degli Angeli (1623-
1697). As Europe was passing through dark ages learning, absorbing and
appreciating the usefulness of the vastly superior Hindu number system, further
advances were being made in India in calculations of trigonometric functions and
their inverses. The demands came from the needs for better navigation and
astronomy requiring very accurate calculations of those functions. In Europe,
Fibonacci’s introduction of the Hindu number system in day-to-day business
calculations became so fruitful and appreciated that it attracted attentions of the
Kings and Queens and generated greater and greater momentum to establish
direct interactions with India via unknown and uncharted sea routes not just for
spices but also for advanced mathematics etc. The fact that European knowledge
about the size of the earth and navigation through its high seas in late fifteenth
century was very primitive remains immortalized in Christopher Columbus’s (1451-
1506) ‘Discovery’ of the ‘New World’ (the Americas) in 1492 while on a voyage
to India through an uncharted and unknown western route.
It is intuitively obvious that the knowledge of advanced mathematical
calculations that makes more accurate navigation through high seas possible will
be of immense interest to the European navigators and their sponsors. By the time
direct link between Europe and India was established in the early sixteenth century
through high seas bypassing the Middle East, mathematical knowledge originating
in India in Sanskrit language, was getting translated into Arabic and then into Latin
and appearing in Europe for many centuries, albeit slowly.  It is indeed Ma–dhava’s
works that came into the attention of James Gregory (1638-1675) during 1664-
1668 when he was sent  (upon the recommendation of Robert Moray (1608-
1673), one of the founders of the Royal Society, Great Britain and its first164
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
President, to study advanced mathematics from Stefano degli Angeli in the University
of Padua (Italy). Brook Taylor (1685-1731) was not yet born when Gregory
published his power series expansion work in 1668, soon after returning to
Scotland. By this time, Mughal Emperor Sha–h Jaha–n in India had already built
(1632-1653) the Taj Mahal. Immediately after the famous Lucasian Chair
professorship of mathematics was created at the Cambridge University of Great
Britain by Henry Lucas, the member of British parliament in December 1663,
Isaac Barrow (1630-1677) was selected as the first occupant of the Chair.
Barrow went (1656) to study mathematics from Vincenzo Viviani in Florence
(Italy). Barrow transferred the acquired knowledge to Isaac Newton whose
development of infinitesimal calculus was kept secret and unpublished for a long
time with Newton not knowing that the knowledge of advanced mathematics that
was imported into various points of what is now Italy was also accessible to
Leibniz through some contemporary parallel routes including direct interactions
with Vincenzo Viviani himself in 1689.
The great grandfather of recognition of mathematics originating from the
Hindu civilization in India and conquering Europe during the first half of the second
millennium is the brilliant work of Fibonacci (Leonardo of Pisa). Progress of the
Hindu civilization in India was severely disrupted by the arrival of Islamic invaders
of various kinds from the northwest. The marching baton of progress in mathematics
and astronomy got abruptly transferred to the Europeans. If one needs further
discriminating and conclusive DNA evidence of paternity of the Gregory series
and Taylor series expansions of mathematical functions, one should check what
mathematical knowledge Stefano degli Angeli of the University of Padua and
Vincenzo Viviani of the University of Florence possessed and from where, when,
and how!  Because it is precisely through these two Italian mathematicians that
the pioneering works of Ma–dhava and Jyes.t.hadeva (ca.1500 - ca. 1575) of the
Hindu civilization entered Great Britain in the second half of the seventeenth
century. Possibility of practical usefulness of newly imported knowledge (for
example, in navigation) is a strong valid reason for keeping the origin secret.
Arrival of increasingly powerful electronic digital computers from the middle
of the twentieth century onwards has brought numerical and computational
mathematics on the center stage of importance very rapidly. Finite difference
methodology employed by Hindu mathematicians from A
– ryabhat.a through
Brahmagupta onwards to Ma–dhava and beyond can now be fully appreciated for165
BOOK REVIEW: CULTURAL FOUNDATION OF MATHEMATICS
their practical importance and advanced nature for the time period during which
it was invented and applied.
In the Hall of fame for science and technology, Sir Isaac Newton (1642-
1727), the second Lucasian Chair Professor of mathematics at the Cambridge
University, Great Britain, appears very tall partly because he, according to his
very own admissions, stands on the shoulders of Giants. Ma–dhava (1350-1425)
of San.gamagra–ma, India, who invented the power series expansion of various
elementary functions is indeed one such Giant of mathematics.  Some three hundred
years after Ma–dhava, mathematician  Brook Taylor (1685-1731) of Great Britain
built (1715) a floor above  Ma–dhava’s work by adding  what is now widely
known as the Taylor Series expansion of a well behaved function that require
existence of derivatives of the function. Beyond Ma–dhava and Jyes.t.hadeva of
India, the concept of derivatives of a well behaved function was further developed
and advanced by Newton, Leibniz and many others in Europe. Therefore,
Ma–dhava by virtue of his advanced work, as explained in Chapter 3 of this book,
can and must rightfully be considered and accepted as the grandfather of calculus.
Present existence of the majestic pyramids in Egypt (the Great Pyramid
of Giza was built around 2560 BC) conclusively proves that geometry was not
invented by Greek mathematicians and scientists like Euclid, Pythagoras (ca. 570
BC – ca. 495 BC), Archimedes (ca. 287 BC – ca. 212 BC)  or Claudius
Ptolemy. Euclid was definitely not a Christian and since his original work does not
exist, one can definitely doubt whether all the ‘Elements’ really go back all the
way to the time period of his stated existence. Professor Raju’s apprehensions,
permeating throughout this book, that true history of mathematics has been severely
distorted by Christian religious zealots of medieval times are somewhat exaggerated.
It is incumbent upon the able descendants of the Hindu civilization and not the
Europeans, to study and narrate the true history of its glorious contributions in
mathematics for educating the world. Professor Raju has assumed that responsibility
and done his duty to the best of his ability. This book will serve as a starting
source for further research in the history of mathematics. Inclusion of this book
in the collections of all libraries around the world is strongly recommended."

TRANSIT OF MERCURY 1651 : THE EARLIEST TELESCOPIC
OBSERVATION IN INDIA

R. K. KOCHHAR

Indian Institute of Astrophysics

(Received 11 March 1988}

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

Life and times of the King-astronomer Jai Singh (1688-1743) constitute a
benchmark in the history of astronomy in India. Following in the footsteps of
Ulugh Bég (1394-1447), astronomer and ruler of Samargand, Jai Singh set out to
update astronomical tables Ulugh Bég had completed three hundred years
previously, in the year 1436.

For this Jai Singh built a number of observatories : in 1724 at Delhi ; in 1734 at
his newly founded capital Jaipur ; and at Mathura, Ujjain, and Varanasi. These
observatories, of which Delhi and Jaipur still survive, consisted of huge, masonary
instruments copied or developed from those used by Ulugh Bég and others of the
Arab school.

When Jai Singh made his imposing but pre-telescopic appearance on the
astronomical scene, telescopic astronomy had already taken roots in Europe. Galileo
used the telescope in 1609. Paris observatory was set up in 1667 and'Greenwichin
1675. P. de la Hire (1640-1718) published his Tabu/ae Astronomicae in 1702, and
the first part of John Flamsteed’s (1646-1719) Historia Coelestis Brittanica
containing his catalogue of stars appeared in 1712.

Thus chronologically belonging to the 18th century, but intellectually to the
15th, Jai Singh with all his enthusiasm and efforts appears as a historical
anachronism.

As we discuss in the next two sections, telescopes had been used in India in the
17th century itself, a good many years before Jai Singh. However, notwithstanding
these sporadic uses of the telescope, modern astronomy did not make a systematic
start in India till the closing decades of the 18th century.

TRANSIT OF MERCURY 1651 : OBSERVATION IN INDIA 187

FATHER RICHAUD’S OBSERVATION AT PONDICHERRY. 1689

A French Jesuit Father Jean Richaud on instructions from the French Academy
of Sciences made astronomical observations, beginning 1689 December, at
Pondicherry in south India with a telescope of about 12 feet focus.' Richaud
observed a comet during 1689 December 8-21 in the constellations of Centaurus
and Lupus, and while doing so discovered on December 19 that the bright star
Alpha Centauri is in fact double. He also estimated the latitude of Pondicherry ;
and its longitude from observations made during 1690 of many eclipses of the first
satellite of Jupiter, to an accuracy of 1 or 2 minutes.

It has generally been believed”? that Richaud’s was the first ever use of a
telescope from the Indian soil. As we shall see now, this is not correct and
telescope had been used in India 38 years previously at Surat by an Englishman
Jeremiah Shakerley (1626-ca. 1655).

SHAKERLEY AND TRANSIT OF MERCURY 1651

Jeremiah Shakerley’ was born in 1626 November at Halifax. Yorkshire,
England, and became interested in mathematics around 1646.

In 1649, Christopher Towneley of Burnley, Lancashire, well known patron of
science in north England, took Shakerley under his wings. The other Towneley
proteges included William Gascoigne (1620-1644) who invented telescope micrometer,
and William Crabtree.

Shakerley was through self-education well acquainted with the works of
Johannes Kepler (1571-1631) and was his enthusiastic supporter. It should be kept
in mind that Kepler had not yet won the day against the ancient system of
astronomy, and the number of astronomers who comprehended Kepler's work at
the time was really small.

Kepler predicted in his Rudolphine Tables (1627) the phenomena of transits of
Mercury and Venus across the disc of the sun. In 1629, barely a year before his
death, Kepler published a pamphlet entitled Admonitio ad Astronomos rerumque
celestium studioses, de miris rarisque anni 1631 phaenomeins. Veneris puta et
Mercurii in solem incursu, in which he predicted a transit of Mercury on 1631
November 7 and of Venus on 1631 December 6. (All dates have been made
Gregorian).>

The 1631 transit of Mercury was seen by Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655) from

Paris. The 163! transit of Venus, unknown to Gassendi, occurred at night and so
went unseen.

Jeremiah Horrocks (1619-1641) using Kepler's and other tables and his own
observations predicted another transit of Venus on 1639 December 5, and observed

188 R. K. KOCHHAR

it using Gassendi’s method, who had projected the sun’s image on a circle whose
circumference was divided into 360° and diameter into 60 parts (ref. 5).

After Horrock’s untimely death his papers were acquired by Towneley and
were available to Shakerley.

Shakerley published three books: (i) A criticism of Vincent Wing's book
Urania Practica titled Anatomy of ‘Urania Practica’ (London. 1649): (ii) An
almanac for /65/ Synopsis Compendiana (London, 1651): and (iii) Tabule
Britannicae (London, 1653).

His 1651 almanac included a supplement where he predicted a transit of
Mercury on 1651 November 3. Shakerley described, citing Horrocks, how best to
observe it using the projection method and enumerated the new astronomical data
that could be obtained by the observation. As the 1651 transit would occur during
night at European latitudes, Shakerley stated that it would be best observed from
eastern countries.

Over the years Shakerley had been receiving patronage from the London
astrologer William Lilly, with whom he was in correspondence (1648-1650). However,
as time progressed Shakerley became increasingly sceptical about astrology and
with his attack on Vincent Wing came his break with Lilly. Presumably because of
his bleak prospects at home, Shakerley emigrated to Surat in India. East India
Company had set up its first trading post (then called a factory) at Surat in 1612.
Fort St.George Madras was founded by the company in 1640, Bombay would he
acquired in 1660, and Calcutta founded in 1690.

It was from Surat that Shakerley observed the transit of Mercury predicted in
his almanac.

The details of Shakerley’s telescope and time-keeper are not available. But in
keeping with the times his telescopes would have had a small aperture, long focus,
single lens as its object glass. We, however, do know about the telescope Horrocks
had used for his observation of the 1639 transit of Venus. Horrock’s was a
telescope magnifying 10-12 times and making an inverted image of the sun 5—54
inches in diameter on an opaque screen.°

Because of the proximity of adjacent buildings and other demands on his time,
Shakerley could make only one sighting, at 6.40 A.M., and even this was hampered
by his lack of adequate instruments. Mercury appeared to be brownish
black, and was less than half arcminute in diameter. Shakerley’s obsevation is
described by Vincent Wing’ who called him ‘the very learned astronomer’.

‘now at 65! 400 he noticed Mercury inside the circle of the solar disc through
the telescope between north and west, as earliest it had been situated between
south and east, and it was away from the centre of the sun exactly 10’. (Shakerlev
also figures in the appendix to Edward Sherburne’s The Sphere of Marcus
Manilius. London, 1675,‘

Shakerley’s calculations are reproduced in Table 1. Shakerley communicated
his results among others to his patron Christopher Towneley and to Henry Osborne
(in 1653 January) who also received a drawing of the solar disc with mercury
marked on it.

Apart from description of the transit, we learn from his letter to Osborne that
Shakerley also observed a comet in 1652, which would thus be the first telescopic
sighting of a comet from India. While in India, he became keenly interested in
Indian calendars.

The letter gives no indication about Shakerley’s occupation in Surat, but it is
certain that he did not make the voyage merely to see the transit, as Vincent Wing
suggested in 1669. It is likely that Shakerley was an employee of the East India
Company although there is no mention of his name in the company’s records for
the early 1650s (ref.4).

Shakerley died presumably in 1655, in India.

TRANSIT OF MERCURY 1651 : OBSERVATION IN INDIA 191

ADVENT OF MODERN ASTRONOMY IN INDIA

Not surprisingly, these sporadic uses of the telescope in India in the 17th
century— by Shakerley in 1651 and by Richaud in 1689—did not make any impact
on the astronomical scene. Indeed, as we have seen, Jai Singh’s masonary
observatories came up more than three decades after Richaud.

While Jai Singh was busy updating Ulugh Bég’s astronomical tables, the empire
set up by Bég’s descendants in India was tottering. The last great Mughal emperor
Aurangzeb died in 1707 an the resulting political vacuum was eventually filled by
the East India company.

Telescopic astronomy could make its systematic appearance in India only in the
later part of the 18th century when the company officers mostly on their own
initiative used telescopes to measure latitudes and sometimes longitudes of places
in the vast territories they increasingly came to control.’ The transits of Venus
1761 and 1769 brought to India many astronomical instruments but a modern
astronomical observatory did not come into existence in India till 1786, when
William Petrie (d.1816), an enlightened officer of the East India Company, set up a
private observatory at his residence at Madras. It was taken over by the Company
in 1790 and led to Kodaikanal Observatory (1899) and Indian Institute of
Astrophysics (1971).""

Professor Balachandra Rao is well known
for his authentic works on Indian mathematics and
astronomy. He has been a research guide for a
number of theses on these subjects, and has written
several research articles. He has several popular
books published debunking myths and questioning
irrational attitudes, both in English and Kannada,
on two such themes, ‘Tradition, Science and
Society’, and ‘Astrology - Believe it or Not’,
reprinted many times. He is well versed in
Kannada and therefore, the readers of Karnataka
are privileged to have access to most of his works
in Kannada. This book introduces mathematics as
known from the time of Vedas in a very simple
narrative. It has been brought out essentially to
educate the common man about the highlights of
mathematics and at the same time clarify some
false claims floating around in print and e-media.
The book under review (29 small chapters)
covers three aspects which are of interest in today’s
context. First, the concepts contained in the
early literature with respect to the mathematical
equations, place values, series, geocentric theorems
and even metrology; second, Vedic Mathematics
– a new term that made entry into textbooks by
virtue of the prefix ‘Vedic’ - which is about the
mental mathematics i.e. quick methods of solving
arithmetic problems and third, contribution of
Trachtenberg.
The first seven chapters cover all aspects
that are contained in the old texts of mathematics
and astronomy. Some very interesting theorems
(attributed now to Greek mathematicians) are also
explained. The chronology of introduction of place
value system is explained. The introduction of
decimal system, symbols used in mathematical
texts and units of measurement for weights,
distances and time are described.
The Śulbasūtras are the oldest texts on
mathematics. They give details on geometry,
arithmetic and to some extent algebra. Interesting
puzzles like squaring a circle, arithmetic and
geometric progressions, indeterminate equations
are covered apart from the construction of altars.
The development of calendars can be
traced from the astronomical deductions. These
are explained in chapter five entitled Vedic
astronomy. Various definitions of the Yuga (which
includes a period of five years) as against the
common man’s belief of “lakhs” of years are
clarified here.
In the seventh chapter, very interesting
allegorical references – with astronomical import
– are analysed. Some such informative episodes
are: (i) Prajāpati chasing Rohiī (Aldebaran); (ii)
Kttikā (Pleiades) constellation rising always in
due east. Around 30th-31st centuries BCE the

declination (krānti) of the star Alcyone (Eta Tauri)
was zero i.e. it was on the celestial equator
(viuvad vtta) and hence that property during that
period (but not now!); (iii) Competition of star
Abhijit (Vega) with Rohiī (Aldebaran); (iv)Yama
(the ruler of the south direction) and the two dogs
(Alpha Canis – Majoris and Minoris); and (v) The
presence of the vernal equinox (Vasanta viuva)
near different visible stars during different
historical periods.
The eighth chapter is an introduction to
the chapters ahead. It is entitled “what is not there
in the Vedas” – this sounds very irritable – because
one cannot have a finite list on what is not there!
But the purpose of the book is to expose the false
claims. Thus the discussion covers aerospace
technology, telegraphy and electricity as claimed
to be from the Vedic texts. Quite obviously the
claims ignore that advancement in technology is
a slow process and demands a very strong
foundation in theory as well as experimentation.
The claim that the speed of light is concealed in a
verse in gveda, also finds a place here. The word
to word meaning and the explanation is written
very clearly so that the reader can make his own
judgements on the claim.
We hear the word “Vedic Mathematics”
springing up in several contexts, school syllabi,
summer programs and “improving” the skills in
mental maths for school children and the like. Prof
Rao discusses the origin of this word which leads
to the techniques popularised by Sri Sri
Bharathikrishna Thirtha (1884–1960), who was
the religious head of the Shankaracharya Math of
Puri. He was well known for his skill in arithmetic,
which he taught for several decades. He devised
several formulae which are easy to memorise and
execute. This increases the efficiency of the
student and is therefore a very useful tool. All the
formulae have been explained in six chapters and
then continue to the methods developed by
Trachtenberg which also fall into the same
category. The controversies about the “Vedic” -
as also the “Mathematics” part - part of Vedic
Mathematics are discussed. This is very important
in understanding the development of knowledge
in the past. The opinions of several scholars are
included. The book concludes with the debate on
whether the Vedic mathematics should be included
in the textbooks at all.
Rao and Navakarnataka Publications need
to be congratulated for bringing out the book,
which is an eye-opener for those who believe in
the false claims. Every student of mathematics
should read and understand the facts. We need very
authentic sourcebooks of this nature to counter
the arguments like “Āryabhaa discovered zero”.
The advantage for publication of the book under
review in regional languages is quite justified since
it is easier to reach all such sections of the society
to avoid them in believing false claims. An English
version also is under preparation."

1, TRIGONOMETRICAL FUNCTIONS. DEFINITIONS.

The Hindu name for the science of Trigonometry is Jyotpatti-ganita or “The
science of calculation for the construction of the sine.’’! It is found as early as in the
Brahma-sphuja-siddhanta of Brahmagupta (628).? Sometimes that name is simplified
into Jyd-ganita (or “The science of calculation of the sines”).3 In very recent years
there has appeared the name Trikonamiti*, whichis a literal as well as phonetic rendering
of the Greek name for the science.

The Hindus introduced and usually employed three trigonometrical functions,
namely jyd, kofi-jya and utkrama-jyd. It should be noted that they are functions of an
arc of a circle, but not of an angle. If AP be an arc of a circle with centre at O, then

its jya= PM, koti-jya=OM and utkrama-jya=OA—OM=AM. Hence their relation
with modern trigonometrical functions will be

jya AP=Rsin 6, kofi-jya AP=Reos 6, utkrama-jya P
AP=R—Rcos 6=Rversin 6, where R is the radius of
the circle and @ the angle subtended at the centre by the
arc AP. Thus the values of the Hindu trigonometrical
functions vary with the radius chosen. The earliest
Hindu treatise in which the above trigonometrical
functions are now found recorded is the Surya-siddhanta.

Jya Fig. 1

The Sanskrit word jya means “a bow-string”; and hence “the chord of an arc”,
for the arc is called “a bow” (dhanu, edpa). Its synonyms are jivd, sifjini guna, maurvi,
etc. This trigonometrical function is also called ardha-jya? (“half -chord”) or jyardha®
(“chord-half”). Thus Bhaskara IT (1150) explicitly observes, “It should be known
that ardha-jyd is here called “jya”.‘ Paramesvara (1430) remarks:

“A part of a circle is of the form of a bow, so it is called the “bow” (dhanu).
The straight line joining its two extremities is the “bow-string” (jiva); it is really
the “full-chord” (samasta-jya). Half of it is here (called) the “half-chord’” (ardha-
Jya), and half that arc is called the “bow” of that half-chord. In fact the Rsine (jya)
and Rcosine (Kofi-jyd) of that bow are always half-chords.’%

Kamalakara (1658) is more explicit. “Having seen the brevity’, says he, “the
half-chords are called Jya@ by mathematicians in this (branch of) mathematics and
are used accordingly.”* The function jya is sometimes distinguished as krama-jyd’ or
kramardha-jya,® from krama, “‘regular”’ or “direct” meaning “direct sine” or ‘“‘direct
half-chord”.

It may be noted that the modern term sine is derived from the Hindu name.
The Sanskrit term jivd was adopted by the early Arab mathematicians but was pro-
nounced as jiba. It was subsequently corrupted in their tongue into jaib. The latter
word was confused by the early Latin translators of the Arabic works such as Gherardo
of Cremona (c. 1150 A.D.) with a pure Arabic word of alike phonetism but meaning
differently “bosom” or “bay” and was rendered as sinus, which also signifies “bosom”
or “‘bay”.®

The degeneration and variations of the term kramajyd are still more interesting.
In the Arabic tongue it was corrupted into karaja or kardaja. According to Fihrist,
the title of a work of Ya‘kib ibn Tarik (c. 770 a.D.) is “On the table of kardaja.”
This table was copied from the Bradhma-sphuta-siddhanta of Brahmagupta. In the
same connexion, al-Khowarizmi (825) used the variant karaja. In the Latin transla-
tions of the term we find several variants such as kardaga, karkaya, gardaga or cardaga.
These terms had in foreign lands also the restricted uses for the arc of 3° 45’, some-
times of 15°.

Koti-Jya
The Sanskrit word Koti means, amongst others “the curved end of a bow” or
“the end or extremity in general’; hence in Trigonometry it came to denote “the
complement of an arc to 90°.”? So the radical significance of the term kofi-jya is
“the jya of the complementary arc’. But it began early to be used as an independent
technical term. The modern term cosine appears to be connected with kofijyd, for
in Hindu works, particularly in the commentaries Kotijyd is often abbreviated into
kojya. When jya@ became sinus, kojya@ naturally became ko-sinus or co-sinus.

Utkrama-Jya

Utkrama means “reversed”, “going out” or “exceeding”. Hence the term
utkrama-jya literally means “reversed sine’’. This function is so called in contradis-
tinction to krama-jya, for it is, rather its tabular values are, derived from the tabular
values of the latter by subtracting the elements from the radius in the reversed
order. Or in other words it is the exceeding portion of the krama-jya@ taken into
consideration in the reversed order. Thus it is stated :

“The (tabular) versed sines are obtained by subtracting from the radius the
(tabular) sines in the reversed order.”4

“They (jyardha), (being subtracted from the radius), in the reversed order begin-
ning from the end, will certainly give the versed sines, that is, the arrows,”’>

Again, it is noteworthy that from a table of differences of sines, the successive
sines are obtained by adding the differences in the direct order (from the top) whereas
the corresponding versed sines will be found by adding the elements in the reversed
order (from the end). This fact has been particularly noted by Siryadeva Yajva (born
1191 a.p.) and Sripati (1039 a.D.). The former observes:

1Woepeke, F. “Sur le mot kardaga et sur une méthode indienne pour calcul les sinus”, Nouv.

vide also Sarton’s note on the point in Jsis, xiv (1930), pp. 421f.

2In Hindu mathematics, the term Kofi also denotes “the side of a right-angled triangle.”

“In order to get the direct sines (krama-jya), these (tabular) differences of sines
(Khanda-jya) should be added regularly from the beginning; and in order to determine
the reversed sines (utkrama-jya), they should be added in the reversed order from
the end.”?

Sripati says:

“The difference of sines are called jyakhanda (tabular “difference of sines’’);
(adding them) in the reversed way beginning from the end will be obtained the versed
sines (vyasta-jya) of the half-arcs equal to the 96th parts of the celestial circle.”?

This function is also called vyasta-jya@ (from vyasta, “cast or thrown asunder”,
“reversed”) or viloma-jya* (from viloma, “‘reverse”’). Occasionally it is termed utkrama-
jyardha® Another name for it is “arrow” (isu, baya).§ Bhaskara II observes:

“What is really the arrow between the bow and the bowstring is known amongst
the scholars here (i.e. in Trigonometry) as the versed sine.”””

So also says Kamalakara (1658):

“What lies between the chord and the arc, like the arrow, is the versed sine.”’®

Tangent and Secant

The Hindus approached very near the tangent and secant functions and actually
employed them in astronomical calculations, though they did not expressly recognise
them as separate functions. The Sirya-siddhanta gives the following rule for calcu-
lating the equinoctial midday shadow of the gnomon at a station:

“The sine of the latitude (of the station) multiplied by 12 and divided by the
cosine of the latitude gives the equinoctial mid-day shadow.’*

Here 12 is the usual height of a Hindu gnomon. So that

_ pa gxh

~ kojya ¢
where ¢ denotes the latitude of the place, S=equinoctial mid-day shadow and A=
gnomon. This is equivalent to

Again to find the mid-day shadow (s) of the gnomon (A) and the hypotenuse
(d), having known the meridian zenith distance (z) of the sun, we have the rules:1

s=h tan z, d=h sec z.

Similar rules occur in other astronomical works also.2 In the Ganita-sdra-samgraha
of Mahavira (850) by the term “shadow” of a gnomon is sometimes meant the ratio
of the actual shadow to the height of the gnomon.? This ratio, as has been just stated,
is equal to the tangent of the zenith distance of the sun.

Quadrants

A circle is ordinarily divided into four equal parts, called vrtta-pada, by two
perpendicular lines, usually the east-to-west line and the north-to-south line. The
quadrants are again classified into odd (ayugma, visama) and even (yugma, sama).
Earlier Hindu writers do not explain this fact fully and particularly. Thus Bhaskara I
(629) simply observes: “Three signs form a quadrant’. Lalla writes:

“Three anomalistic signs form a quadrant. The quadrants are successively dis-
tinguished as odd and even.”>

But the description of Bhaskara IT (1150) is very full. He says:

“Three signs together form a quadrant. In a circle there will be four such; and
they should be successively called odd and even.”*

He then explains it further thus:

“On a plane surface describe a circle of any specified radius with a pair of com-
passes. Mark on its circumference 360 degrees. Draw the east-to-west and north-
to-south lines through its centre. These lines will divide the circle into quadrants,
which should be taken into consideration in the leftwise manner (savya-krama, that
is ‘anti-clockwise’’) proceeding from the east-point (prdci ); they should be called
odd and even (quadrants) successively.”®

Variation in value
As regards the variation in the value of a trigonometrical function as its argument
changes, Bhaskara II observes as follows:

1$aSi, iii, 21.

2PSi, iv. 22.

8GSS, ix. 84.

4MBh, iv. 1; LBh, ii. 1.

s$iDVr, ii. 10.

*Si$i, Graha, ii. 19.

""The Sanskrit term savya-krama ordinarily signifies the “clockwise direction”; but it may also
denote the “anti-clockwise direction.”

*8SiSi, Graha, ii, 19 (Gloss).

44 BIBHUTIBHUSAN DATTA AND AVADHESH NARAYAN SINGH

“In the first quadrant, mark a point on the circumference of the circle at any
optional distance from the east point. The perpendicular distance of that point from
the east-to-west line is called the Rsine (doh-jya); and its distance from the north-
to-south line is the Reosine (kofi-jya). The corresponding arcs are called bhuja and
koti. (Starting from the east point) as the point gradually moves forward in the same
way (ie. anti-clockwise), the Rsine increases and the Reosine decreases. When the
point arrives at the end of the quadrant, the Rcosine vanishes and the Rsine is equal
to the radius. Then in the second quadrant, the Rcosine increases; at the end of
that quadrant the Reosine is maximum (irrespective of sign) and the Rsine vanishes.”*

One fact perhaps deserves a particular notice here. It is that in Hindu trigono-
metry the jyd of an arc of 90° in a circle is equal to the radius of that circle. On
account of that, the radius is called in Hindu mathematics by the terms #ri-jya, tri-
bha-jyd, tribhavana-jyd, etc., every one of which literally means the “sine of three
signs.” The radius is also called viskambhardha, vyasardha, or ardha-vyayama meaning
the “‘semi-diameter”. All these terms are very old.

Functions of a complement or supplement
Surya-siddhanta says:

“In odd quadrants, the arc passed over gives the Rsine, while the arc to be
passed over gives the Rcosine; and in the even quadrants, the arc to be passed over
gives the Rsine and that passed over gives the Rcosine.”*

Bhaskara I writes:

“In the odd quadrants the arc described and that to be described should res-
pectively be known as the bhuja and koji; but in the even quadrants they are respectively
the Koti and bhuja; this is the fact.’

Lalla remarks:

“When (the anomaly® is) greater than 90°, it is subtracted from the semi-circle
(ie. 180°); when greater than the semi-circle, 180° is subtracted from it; when greater
than 270°, it is subtracted from the complete circle (i.e. 360°); the remainder is called
the (coriesponding) bhuja by the expert in the subject.’¢

bid, ii. 20 (Gloss). The Sanskrit terms jya and kejyd have been translated as Rsine and Rcosine
because they are equal to Rxsine and Rxcosine respectively.

other Hindu mathematicians, occurs.

*SIDVp ii. 10-11.

HINDU TRIGONOMETRY 45
In the words of Brahmagupta:

“The Rsine and Rcosine (are obtained) in the odd quadrants from the arc
passed over and to be passed over (respectively); and in the even quadrants in the
reverse way.” Or,

“In the odd quadrants (the Rsine is determined) from the arc described and in
the even quadrants from the arc to be described.”?

“(For the determination of) the Rsine (proceed with the anomaly as it is) when
the anomaly is less than three signs (i.e. 90°); when greater than three signs subtract
it from six signs; when greater than six signs, subtract six signs (from it); when greater
than nine signs, subtract it from the complete circle.”’3

Maijijula (932) says:

“In the odd quadrants, the bhuja and koti are (to be calculated) from the arc des-
cribed and that to be described (respectively); but in the even quadrants in the con-
trary way.’

His commentator and younger contemporary Pragastidhara (962) dilates upon
this point thus:

“In the odd quadrant, where the anomaly is less than three signs (i.e. 90°), the
Rsine should be calculated from it and the Rcosine should be calculated after sub-
tracting that from 90°. In the even quadrant, where the anomaly exceeds 90° but is
less than 180°; in that case the Rsine should be taken after subtracting it from 180°
and the cosine after subtracting 90° from it. In the odd quadrant, where the anomaly
is greater than 180°, but less than 270°, the Rsine should be calculated after subtracting
180° from it and the Reosine after subtracting it from 270°. In the even quadrant —
when the anomaly exceeds 270°, but is less than 360°, the Rsine is determined after
subtracting it from 360°, and the Rcosine after subtracting 270° from it.’

Sripati (c. 1039) remarks:

“In the odd and even quadrants, the arc passed over and to be passed over (respec-
tively) is the bhuja and the Kofi is otherwise. Or, as the learned have said, the Rsine
of 90° minus the anomaly is the Rcosine (of the anomaly).’é

root of the remainder will be the Rcosine. Again the square-root of the square of the

versed Rsine of the complement of an arc is equal to the Rsine of the arc, and minus
the versed Rsine of the arc becomes the Rsine of the other (i.e. complement).’”?

The treatment of Bhaskara IL is exhaustive. He says:

“Subtract from the radius the direct Rsine of an arc and of its complement; the
Tesults will be the versed R sines of the complement and the arc (respectively). Sub-
tract from the radius the versed Rsine of an arc and of its complement; the remainders

Change of Sign of a Function

The Hindus were fully aware of the changes of sign of a trigonometrical function
according as its argument lies in different quadrants. Though nowhere do we find
any systematic treatment of this principle in any Hindu work there are ample con-
crete instances of its application in almost all their important astronomical treatises.
Thus it is stated in the Sarya-siddhanta:

“The sighra kofiphala is positive, when the kendra (mean anomaly) lies in a posi-
tion beginning with the Capricorn; and it is to be subtracted from the radius in a posi-
tion beginning with the Cancer.’

Now according to the Sirya-siddhanta and other Hindu astronomical works,
the sighra kofiphala (the result derived from the complement of the distance from the
conjunction) is given by Dcos 9, where @ is the Sighra kendra® (the distance of the mean
planet from its apex of swiftest motion; hence mean Sighra anomaly) and D, a certain
known constant. The Cancer is the fourth sign of the Zodiac and Capricorn is the tenth
sign. Again the motion of the mean planet is anti-clockwise. Hence it is clear from.

1$iSi, Graha, ii. 21, :

4S3Si, Gola, v. 2; xiv. 4.

3SiT Vi, ii. 56-7.

“SaSi, ti. 40.

Subtract the longitude of a planet from that of its apex of slowest motion (nandocca); so

also subtract it from that of its apex of swiftest motion (conjunction); the result (in either case) is
its Kendra.” S&Si, ii. 29.

HINDU TRIGONOMETRY 49

the above rule that the author was aware that the cosine of an angle lying between
0° and 90° or between 270° and 360° is positive and that it is negative when the angle
lies between 90° and 270°.

Again it has been said:

“In case of the manda and Sighra corrections of all planets, the phala
(equation) will be positive, if the kendra lies in the six signs beginning with the Aries
and it will be negative in the six signs beginning with the Libra,”?

Now the phala is defined as arc (D’sin 0), where D’ does not change sign.
Hence clearly the author knows that the sign is positive in the first two quadrants and
negative in the other two quadrants.

Similar rules are found in other treatises of astronomy.” The statement of Majijula
(932) is more explicit and fuller. He says:

“The (mean) planet when diminished by its apogee or aphelion is the kendra
(mean anomaly). Its Rsine is positive or negative in the upper or lower halves (of the
quadrants); and its Rcosine is positive, negative, negative, and positive (respectively)
according to the (successive) quadrants,’

Thus the Hindus knew very early what in modern trigonometrical notations will,
be expressed as—-

sin (7 -4)= +sin 6, cos ( = 0)=—cos 0

sin (2n—@)==—-sin 6, cos (27—0)=+c0s @
fT ay Ton) ng
sin ( 3 F @ )=-+e0s 9, cos ( 3 ) sin 8
32 3a

sin FF) =—00s 6, cos (+8 )=—Fsin 6

Again it has been stated before that according to a rule of Brahmagupta
R-Liya (a—90°) =utjya a.
But by definition,
utjya 4=R—kojya «=R—jya (90°—a).

VR—(jya «=kojya «, VR—(kojya «Piya a.
These are of course equivalent to the modein formulae
V1—sin? 6=cos 6, Vi1—cos? O=sin @
or sin? @+cos? @=1,

where @ is the angle subtended at the centre of the circle by the arc «.
(2) 4 sin? 3 ==sin® 6+-versin? 6

This formula has been stated first by Varahamihira (505).
He says:

“To find the Rsine of any other desired arc, double the arc and subtract from the
quarter of a circle; diminish the radius by the Rsine of the remainder. The square of
half the result is added to the square of half the Rsine of the double arc. The square-
root of the sum is the desired Rsine.’* y

Let the arc XP = arc PQ = «;thenarc QY = 90°—2.

Now
XQ? = QT? + TX?
or 4 XD? = QT? + TX?
or XD* = (QT/2)? +- (TX/2).

Hence
2 (v4 ay ( R= Jya (90° — 24))?,
(iya 4) ( + 5) ) ;
which is equivalent to

4 sin? 6 = sin® 26 + versin? 26.

Aryabhata I (499) seems to have beenaware of this formula before Varahamihira.
It reappears also in later works.

Brahmagupta says:

“The sum of the squares of the Rsine and versed Rsine of the same arc is divided
by four; subtract this quotient from the squate of the radius, Take the square-root of
the two results. The former will be the Rsine of half that arc, and the other the Rsine
of the arc equal to the quarter circle less that half.”

The formula has been described almost similarly by Sripati (1039)?. Bhaskara II
(1150) writes very briefly thus:

“Half the square-root of the sum of the square of the Rsine and of the versed
Rsine of an arc, will be the Rsine of half that arc.”

Parameévara (1430) says:

“The square-root of the sum of the square of the Rsine and of the versed Rsine
of an arc is the ‘whole chord’ (samasta-jya) of that arc. Half that is the half-chord
(i.e. the Rsine) of half that arc.’**

Q
(3) 2sin? 5 = 1— cos 4

This is given first by Varahamihira. He says:

“Twice any desired arc is subtracted from three signs (i.e. 90°), the Rsine of the
remainder is subtracted from the Rsine of three signs. The result multiplied by sixty
is the square of the Rsine of that arc.’5

Hence (jyd «)? = 4 R {R— jyd (90° — 2«)}.

The factor 4 R on the right-hand side has been stated by Varahamihira as 60 since
he has taken the valve of the radius to be equal to 120. In modern notations, the
above formula becomes—

sin? @ = 3 (I—cos 28).

This also follows easily from the preceding formula.

Brahmagupta says:

“The square-root of the fourth part of the versed Rsine of aa arc multiplied by
the diameter is the Rsine of half that arc.”?

Bhaskara II writes:

“Or, the square-root of half the product of the radius and the versed Rsine of an
arc, will be the Rsine of half that arc.’

He has further given the following proof of it.*

This formula first appears in the works of Aryabhata II (950). He says:

“The Rsine of any arc multiplied by the radius is subtracted from or added to the
square of the maximum value of the Rsine; the square-root of half the results are
extracted. These will be the Rsine of 45° decreased or increased by half that arc.’

Let the arc XP be denoted by «. Bisect the complementary arc YP at Q. Then

YP? = YN?4NP*
= (OY—PM)°+PN?
= OY?+PM?+0M?—2 OY.PM.

Therefore,
4 PC?=2 (OP?—-OP.PM).

Hence, jyd $ (90°—a) = »/] (R?—R. jyaa): Fig. 5
Similarly it can be proved that

yt 00° +4) = VE(RPER. jydx)-
These are of course equivalent to

sin 3 (90° + 6) = VE (i sin 6).

Bhaskara IT (1150) writes:

“The square of the radius is diminished or increased by the product of the radius
and the Rsine of an arc; the square-root of half the results will be the Rsine of the
half of 90° minus or plus that arc.”

Kamalikara defines:

“The product of the radius and the Rsine of an arc is added to or subtracted from
the square of the radius. The square-root of the half of the results are taken. They
will respectively be the Rsine of the half of three signs plus or minus the arc.’

Bhaskara II (1150) says:

“The Rsines of any two arcs of a circle are reciprocally multiplied by their
Rcosines; the products are then divided by the radius; the sum of the quotients is
equal to the Rsine of the sum of the two arcs; and their difference is the Rsine
of the difference of the arcs.’

If « and 8 be any two arcs, then the rule says:

which is equivalent to

sin (0 ¢)=sin 8 cos ¢ + cos 6 sin ¢.

In the words of Kamalakara (1658):

“The quotients of the Rsines of any two arcs of a circle divided by its radius are
reciprocally multiplied by their Rcosines; the sum and difference of them (the products)
are equal to the Rsine of the sum and difference respectively of the two arcs.’’2

The rule for finding the Reosine of the sum and difference of two arcs of a circle
is enunciated by Kamalakara thus:

“The product of the Rcosines and of the Rsines of two arcs ofa circle are divided
by its radius; the difference and sum of them (the quotients) are equal to the Reosine
of the sum and difference (respectively) of the two arcs.”?

kojva («+6) kojya kaya B ea <i B

which is equivalent to

Though we do not find this Rcosine theorem in the printed editions of the works of
Bhaskara II, we are quite sure that it was known to him. For it has been attributed to
him by his most relentless critic Kamalakara? as well as by his commentator Munisvara.

The above theorems can be proved by methods algebraical as well as geometrical.
Several such proofs were given by previous writers, observes Kamalakara* (1658).
Unfortunately we have not been able to trace them as yet. The following two geome-
trical proofs are found in the Siddhanta-tattva-viveka® of Kamalakara.

First Proof. Let the are YP=B, and
arc YO=a; « being greater then f. Join

Draw PN, PM perpendicular to OY,OX
respectively. Also draw QS perpendicular
to OY, and produce it to meet the circle
again at QO’. Draw QT, Q'T' perpendi-

The above theorems are called Bhavand (“‘demonstration” or “proof” meaning

“any thing demonstrated or proved”, hence “theorem”).

They are again divided into Samdsa-bhdvand or Yoga-bhavana (‘Addition

Theorem”) and Antara-bhavand ot Viyoga-bhavana (“Subtraction Theorem”).1

In the proofs given above the arcs « and f have been tacitly assumed to be each
less than 90°. But the theorems are quite general and hold true even when the arcs are

greater than 90°.

Thus Kamalakara observes:

“Even when the two arcs go beyond 90° to any even or odd quadrant (the theo-
rems) will remain the same, not otherwise. That is the opinion of those who are aware

of the true facts.’?

Functions of Multiple Angles

As corollaries to the general case of the theorems for expanding sin (6-4) and
cos (6+ ¢), Bhaskara IT (1150) indicates how to derive the functions of multiple angles.
He observes:

“This being proved, it becomes an argument for determining the values of other
functions. For example, take the case of the combination of functions of equal arcs:
by combining the functions of any arc with those of itself, we get the functions of
twice that arc; by combining the functions of twice the arc with those of twice the arc,
we get functions of four times that arc; and so on. Next take the case of combination
of functions of unequal arcs: on combining the functions of twice an arc with those of
thrice that arc, by the addition theorem we get the functions of five times that arc;
but by the subtraction theorem, we get the functions of one time that arc; and so on.”

The theorems meant here are clearly these:

sin2@ = 2 sin @ cos 0,
cos 20 = cos?6 — sin?4,
sin4@ = 2sin2@ cos 26,

= 4sin @ cos @ (cos? ¢—sin® 8),
cos 48 = cos? 2@—sin® 26,

= cos! 6 — 6 sin®@cos?6-+ sin? 4,
sin 38 = 3 sin@ cos?@—sin?6,
cos 30 = cos?6é—3 cosé sin*@,
sin 58 = sin 26 cos 36+ cos 26 sin 38,
cos 56 = cos 26 cos 3@—sin 286 sin 36,
sind = sin 3@ cos 26—cos 3@ sin 26,
cos® == cos 36 cos 26+sin 384 sin 26.

All these theorems have been expressly stated by Kamalakara (1658).

He says:

“Hereafter I shall describe how to find the Rsine of twice, thrice, four times or
five times an arc, having known the Rsine of the sum of two arcs. The product of the
Rsine and Reosine of an arc is multiplied by 2 and divided by the radius; the result
is the Rsine of twice that arc.’

“The difference of the squares of the Rsine and Rcosine of an arc is divided
by the radius; the quotient is certainly the Rcosine of twice that arc.’

He has given the following proof of the above two formulae.‘

“Find the cube of one-third the Rsine of an arc; divide it by the square of the

of a circle is equal to its semi-diameter. The hypotenuse arising from the base and
perpendicular (of a right-angled triangle) each equal to the semi-diameter is the chord
of the fourth part of the circumference. Half those (chords) will be the Rsines of half
those arcs.””?

The same proof is also given by Bhaskara II :?

“The side of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle is equal to its radius; this is
well known and has also been stated in (my) Arithmetic. Hence follows that the Rsine
of 30° is half the radius.”

“Suppose a right-angled triangle whose base and perpendicular are each equal
to the radius; the square-root of the sum of the squares of these will be equal to the
side of a square inscribed in that circle and it is again the chord of 90°. Take the half of
that. Hence the sum of the squares (of the sides) is divided by four; and the result is
half the square of the radius. The square-root of that, it thus follows, is the Rsine
of 45°.”

Comparing the two tables we find that except in case of sin 7/7 and sin 7/9 Bhaskara’a
approximations are correct up to five places of decimals; in these two latter cases the
results are near enough.

Approximate Formula of Bhaskara I

Bhaskara I (629) has given the following rule for the calculation of the Rsine
and Rcosine of an arc without the help of a table.

“Subtract the arc in degrees from the degrees of the semi-circumference and
multiplying the arc by the remainder, put down (the result) at two places, (at one
place) subtract (the quantity) from 40500; by one-fourth of the 1emainder divide the
quantity (at the second place) multiplied by the maximum value of the function; thus
the value of the direct or reversed Rsine of an arc and its complement is obtained
wholly.”

If « be an arc of a circle of radius R in terms of degrees, then
R(C/2— «)a
Das = 500 —(C—a) «4

where C denotes the circumference of the circle in terms of degrees. Since
40500=(5/4) x 180 x 180, we can write the formula in the form

ae _AR(C (Ra)
IVE = Sa (Cf2)>-—(C]2-—a) &
which is of course equivalent to
4(r— 8) 8
(5/4) w?— (9 — 8) a

From a statement of Bhaskara I it appears that this formula was known to Arya-
bhata I.?

sin 6 =

The above formula has been restated by Brahmagupta (628) thus:

“Subtract the degrees of an arc or its complement from the semicircle (i.e. 180)
and multiply (the remainder) by that; subtract one-fourth the product from 10125;
divide the product by the remainder and multiply by the semi-diameter ; (the result)
is the Rsine of that (arc or its complement).’’?

Almost in the same way Sripati (1039) says:

“Subtract the degrees of an arc or its complement from 180 and multiply (the
remainder) by that; subtract one-fourth the product from 10125; multiply the product
by the semi-diameter and divide by this remainder; thus the Rsine of an arc or its
complement can be found even without (a table of Rsines).””!

Bhaskara IT (1150) writes:

“Subtract an arc from the circumference and multiply (the remainder) by the arc;
this product is called the ‘first’. From five times the fourth part of the square of the
circumference subtract the ‘first’, and by the remainder divide the ‘first’ multiplied by
four times the diameter; the quotient will be the chord of the arc.’”?

If s denote the chord of an arc 8 of a circle, then

, — SR(C=A)R
3C—(C—BR

Now if B=2a, then s=2jyd «. So that on making the substitutions this formula will
easily reduce to that of the elder Bhaskara.

This formula has been used by Ganesa (1545) in his Grahalaghava.? Though it
gives only a roughly approximate (sthiila) value of the Rsine of an arc, observes
Bhaskara II, it simplifies operations.

On putting @ = m/2—d, in the above approximate formula, it becomes

If we put * = 4/10 approximately, we get

Again putting ¢ =7/n in Bhaskara I’s formula, where n is an integer, we get

16 (n—1)

sin alin = 5 —4(n —1)

whence we have

sin 7/7= -4343...., sin /8= 3835 ...., sin 7/9= -3431 ....,
which are correct up to two places of decimals, the third figure in every case being too
large.

Inverse Formula of Brahmagupta

Brahmagupta gave the following rule for finding approximately the arc corres-
ponding to a given Rsine function:

“Multiply 10125 by the given Rsine and divide by the quarter of the given Rsine
plus the radius; subtracting the quotient from the square of 90, extract the square-root
and subtract (the root) from 90; the remainder will be in degrees and minutes; thus will
be found the arc of the given Rsine without the table of Rsines,”+

If « be the arc corresponding to the given Rsine function m, then the rule says that

10125m
= 90 — 8100 — ———
« v (m/4-+r)

This result follows easily on reversing the approximate formula for the Rsine and
was very likely obtained in the same way.

Therefore,

Sripati describes the inverse formula thus:

“Multiply 10125 by the given Rsine and divide by the quarter of the given Rsine
plus the radius; then subtract the quotient from the square of 90; ninety degrees lessened
by the square root (of the remainder) will be the arc (determined) without the table of
Rsines.”""?

Bhaskara II writes:

“By four times the diameter added with the chord divide the square of the circumfe-
rence multiplied by five times a quarter of the chord; the quotient being subtracted from
the fourth part of the square of the circumference, and the square-root of the remainder
being diminished from half the circumference, the result will be the arc.’”?

5. TRIGONOMETRICAL TABLES
Twenty-four Sines

The Hindus generally calculate tables of trigonometrical functions for every arc
of 3°45’, or what they call twenty-four Rsines in a quadrant. In the choice of 24,
they seem to have been led by an ancient observation that “the ninety-sixth part of a
circle looks (straight) like a rod”. Thus Balabhadra (c. 700 A.D.) observes, “If anybody
asks the reason of this, he must know that each of these Kardajat is 1/96 of the circle
= 225 minutes (= 3% degrees). And if we reckon its Rsine, we find it also to be 225
minutes.”8

The origin of this idea again lies in the impression that the human eye-sight
reaches to a distance of 1/96th part of the circumference of the earth which appears

1$iSe, iii. 18.
aL, vs. 212, p. 216.
*Quoted by ALBirini in his India (Sachau, Alberuni’s India, I, p. 275). Balabhadra’s works
are now ke lost. According to Chambers’ Mathematical Tables, we find
sin (3° 45’)= 0654031, tan a 45’) = 0655435, radian (3° 45°) = -0654498, so that the
assumption is fairly accurate.

HINDU TRIGONOMETRY 75

flat.1 A more plausible hypothesis about the choice of 3°45’ as the unit will be this:
Having determined previously a very accurate value of = it was simply natural for the
Hindus to choose the radius of the circle of reference to be 3438’. They also knew that
Rsin 30°=semi-radius=1719'. Starting with this they began to calculate the function
of the semi arcs 15°, 7° 30’, 3°45’ with the help of the well known formulae and in so
doing they soon found that 3° 45’ is the first whose Rsine contains the same number of
minutes as the arc. So they chose this arc.?

Sarya-Siddhanta

The earliest known Hindu work to contain a table of trigonometrical functions is
the Sarya-Siddhanta (c. 300 A.D.). It has a table of Rsines and versed Rsines for every
arc of 3°45’ of a circle of radius 3438’. The method of computation has been indicated
to be as follows:

“The eighth part of the number of minutes in a sign (i.e. 225’) is the first Rsine.
It is divided by itself and then diminished by the quotient; the remainder added with
the first Rsine gives the second Rsine.

“(Any) Rsine is divided by the first Rsine and then diminished by the quotient.
The remainder added to the difference of that Rsine and the preceding Rsine will give
the next Rsine. Thus can be obtained the 24 Rsines, which are as follows.’

eT 50

This little discrepancy, however, does not make much difference in the values
of the Rsine functions calculated on the basis of that formula. They are indecd fairly
accurate even according to modern calculations except in a few instances.!

About this method of constructing the tables of R sines, Delambre remarks: ‘‘The
method is curious; it indicates a method of calculating the table of sines by means
of their second differences.”? He then goes on: “This differential process has not up
to now been employed except by Briggs who himself did not know that the constant
factor was the square of the chord AA (==3° 45’) or of the interval, and who could
not obtain it except by comparing the second differences obtained in a different manner.
The Indians also have probably done the same; they obtained the method of differences
only from a table calculated previously by a geometric process. Here then is a method
which the Indians possessed and which is found neither amongst the Greeks, nor
amongst the Arabs,’

We do not understand what valid grounds were there for Delambre to suppose that
the Hindus discovered the above theorem of Rsines by inspection after having
calculated the table of Rsines by a different method. For there is absolutely no doubt

78 BIBHUTIBHUSAN DATTA AND AVADHESH NARAYAN SINGH

that the ancient Hindus were in possession of necessary and sufficient equipments to
derive it in either of the ways indicated above. It is noteworthy that that theorem has
an important geometrical foundation. If there be three arcs of a circle in arithmetical
progression the sum of the sines of the two extreme arcs is to the sine of the middle
arc as the sine of twice the common difference is to the sine of that difference. For

This very remarkable property of the circle was discovered in Europe by Vieta
(1580)!,

Aryabhata

The trigonometrical table of Aryabhata I (499) contains the differences between the
successive Rsines for arcs of every 3° 45’ of a circle of radius 3438’.2 His first method
of computing it, which is rather cryptic, seems to be the same as that followed by
Varahamihira (infra). The other is practically the same as that of the Siarya-siddhanta,
though put in a different form. He says:

“Divide a quarter of the circumference of a plane circle (into as many equal parts
as desired). From (right) triangles and quadrilaterals (can be obtained) the Rsines of
equal arcs, as many as desired, for (any given) radius.””?

What is meant by the author is very probably this: If y
P be any point on the arc of the quadrant, draw the per-
pendiculars PM and PN; also join PX. So that corres-
ponding to P we havea rectangle PMON and a right-angled
triangle PMX. Now having given the Rsine(PM) of the arc N Pp
XP (=a), we can determine from the rectangle PMON the
side PN which is the sine of the arc (90° —«). Having
found PN, we can calculate MX, which is equal to R—jya
(90° —«). Then in the right-angled triangle PMX, we 0 yu x
can determine the chord PX. Half of this is jya@ «/2. Again Fig. 12

HINDU TRIGONOMETRY 79

from a similar set of a rectangle and a right-angled triangle corresponding to the
half arc, we can calculate jy@ (90°—«/2) and jya@ «/4. Proceeding thus we can
compute the Rsines of as many equal arcs as we please and it is clear that in so
doing the quadrant will be broken up into a system of right-angled triangles and
rectangles, as contemplated in the rule.

This is the interpretation of Aryabhata’s rule by his ancient commentators,
like Siryadeva Yajva and Paramesvara (1430). Another interpretation will be this:
The quadrant is trisected by the inscribed equilateral triangle and bisected by the
inscribed square. The length of the arc between these points is 15° (=45°—30°).
One-fourth of this is 3° 45’. So that the rule under discussion indicates how to divide
the quarter of the circumference into portions of 3° 45’ each. If this interpretation is
right}, which is rather forced, then it will have to be said that Aryabhata J gave only
one method of computing the trigonometrical table.”

The second method of Aryabhata I is this:

“The first Rsine divided by itself and then diminished by the quotient will give
the second difference (of tabular Rsines). For computing any other difference, (the
sum of) all the preceding differences is divided by the first Rsine and the quotient is
subtracted from the preceding difference. Thus, all the remaining differences (can
be calculated).”?

Let Ay, Agy-.- ees s/n denote successive differences of the tabular Rsines, such
that, « being equal to 3° 45’,

“The first Rsine is divided by itself and then diminished by the quotient; the
result with the first Rsine will give the second Rsine. For (computing), any of the
Temaining Rsines, the sum of all the Rsines preceding it is divided by the first Rsine
and the quotient is subtracted from the first Rsine, and the result added to the

comparison with the known values of the sines of 30°, 45°, 60°; or what is much more
likely employed the formula only to calculate the Rsines of intermediate arcs. Other
plausible explanations of the discrepancy have been furnished by Krishnaswami

says he, the other Rsines may be computed. Lalla’ gives a table of Rsines and
versed Rsines for the radius 3438’. His method of computation is the same as that of
Aryabhata I and the Sirya-siddhdnta. He has also a shorter table of Rsines and their
differences for intervals of 10° of arcs of a circle of radius 150.°

Brahmagupta

Brahmagupta (628) takes the radius quite arbitrarily to be 3270. His explana-

indicated two methods of computation.® One is graphic and the other mathematical.

Graphic Method. “Starting from the joint of two quadrants, mark off successively
(on either directions) portions of arcs equivalent to the eighth part of a sign (30°).
Join two and two of these marks by threads. Half of them (lengths of threads) will be
the Rsines.”10

From the known value of the Rsine of 8, that is, of 30°,« being equal to 3° 45’, we
can calculate, by (a), the Rsines of 4, 2x, 4. Then by (6) will be obtained the Rsine
of 20«, 22x, 23x Again from the first two of the latter results, we shall obtain, by (a),
the Rsines of 10« and 11«; and thence by (6) the Rsines of 14 and 13«. Continuing
similar operations, we can compute the Rsines of 5x and 194, 7 and 17. Again
starting with the Rsine of 12, we shall obtain on proceeding in the same way, succes-
sively the values of the Rsines of 64 and 18«; 3x and 21; 9« and 152. Thus the values
of all the twenty-four Rsines are computed.

It is perhaps noteworthy that Rsin n« is called by Brahmagupta as the nth Rsine.
The successive order in which the various Rsines have been obtained above can be
exhibited as follows:

Brahmagupta then observes: “In this way (can be computed) the Rsines in
greater or smaller numbers, having known first the Rsines of the sixth, fourth and
third parts of the circumference of the circle.”! He further remarks that the Rsine
of the semi-arc can be more easily calculated by the second formula of Varahamihira.?
Brahmagupta has also another table giving differences of Rsines for every 15° of a
circle of radius 150.5

Aryabhata If and Sripati

Aryabhata II (950) gives the same table as that of the Sarya-siddhanta.4 But his
method of computation is entirely different.5 He takes recourse to the formulae

Beginning with the known values of Rsin 30° and Rsin 45°, like Brahmagupta, the

can be best exhibited thus:

The table of Sripati (c. 1039) gives the Rsines and versed Rsines for every 3° 45’
of a circle of radius 3415.1 His first method of computing it is the same as the graphic
method of Brahmagupta. He says:

“Place marks at the eighth parts of a sign (30°); then (starting) from the joint of
two quadrants, following up these marks, join two and two of them successively by
means of threads; half of them will be the Rsines.”?

The Second method followed by Sripati is identical with the mathematical
method of Brahmagupta.®

Bhaskara II

The table of Bhaskara II (1150) contains the Rsines and versed Rsines as well
as their differences for every 3° 45’ of a circle of radius 3438’. He has indicated several
methods of computing it. The first is practically the same as Brahmagupta’s graphic
method. He says:

“For computing the Rsines, take any optional radius. On a plane ground describe

a circle by means of a piece of thread equal to that radius. On it mark the cardinal
points and 360 degrees; so in each quadrant of the circle there will be 90 degrees. Then
divide every quadrant into as many equal parts as the number of Rsines to be com-
puted and put marks of these divisions. For instance, if it be required to calculate
24 Rsines, there will be 24 marks. Then beginning from any of the cardinal points,
and proceeding either ways, the threads connecting the successive points will be the
chords. There will be thus 24 chords. Halves of these will be the Rsines (required).
So these half-chords should be measured and the results taken as the Rsines.’”*

HINDU TRIGONOMETRY 85

The second is again a reproduction of Brahmagupta’s theoretical method:

“When twenty-four Rsines are required (to be computed), the Rsine of 30° is
the eighth element; its Rcosine is the sixteenth; and Rsin 45° is the twelfth. From
these three elements, twenty-four elements can be computed in the way indicated.
From the eighth we get the Rsine of its half, that is, the fourth (element), its Rcosine
is the twentieth. Similarly from the fourth, the second and the twenty-second; from
the second, the first and the twenty-third. In the same way from the eighth are ob-
tained the tenth and fourteenth, fifth and nineteenth, seventh and seventeenth,
eleventh and thirteenth. Again from the twelfth follow the sixth and eighteenth,
third and twenty-first, ninth and fifteenth. The radius is the twenty-fourth Rsine.”

The third method of computing trigonometrical tables described by Bhaskara II
is the same as that of Aryabhata II. The speciality of this method, as also of the two
following, is, says Bhaskara II, that it does not employ the versed Rsine function,
As for the successive order of derivation, he points out that “from the eighth Rsine
(will be obtained) the sixteenth; from the sixteenth, the fourth and the twentieth;
from the fourth, the tenth and fourteenth. In this way all the rest may be deduced.”?

The fourth method of Bhaskara II is based on the application of the formula
Rsin 50-#) = 5 {(Rsin 6 — Rsin $)* + (Roos 6 — Roos $)*

“so that knowing any two Rsines others may be derived. For instance, let one be
the fourth Rsine and the other eighth Rsine. From them is derived the second Rsine.
From the second and fourth, the first; and so on.”

The fifth method depends on the formula

Rsin (45°—8)= / 4(Reos @— Rsin 8 .

“Thus, for instance, take the eighth Rsine; its Rcosine is the sixteenth Rsine. From
these the fourth is derived; and so on.”*

All the theoretical methods described above require the extraction of the square-
root. So Bhaskara II propounds a new method (the sixth) in which that will not be
necessary. It is based on the employment of the formula
2 (Rsin_ 6)

R

But this method is defective in as much as “only certain elements of a table of Rsines
can be calculated thus,”! but not the whole table. This defect is present in a sense in
the previous methods, for no one of the trigonometrical formulae employed in them
suffices alone for the computation of a table containing more Rsines (vide infra).

The seventh method of Bhaskara II for calculating a table of twenty-four Rsines,
has been described thus:

“Multiply the Rcosine by 100 and divide by 1529; diminish the Rsine by its
ei part. The sum of these two results will give the next Rsine and their difference
the previous Rsine. Here 225 less 1/7 is the first Rsine. And by this rule can be succes-
sively calculated the twenty-four Rsines.”?

Bhiskara II has indicated how to compute a table of Rsines for every 3° of a
circle of radius 3438’. He writes:

“For instance if (it be required to compute) thirty Rsines in a quadrant, half the
radius is the tenth Rsine, its Rcosine is the twentieth Rsine. Rsin 45° is the fifteenth
Rsine; Rsin 36° is the twelfth and Rcos 36° the eighteenth. The Rsine of 18° is the
sixth and its Reosine is the twenty-fourth. Then by the rule for deriving the Rsine of
the half arc from the square-root of the sum of the squares of the Rsine and versed
Rsine of an arc, as stated before, from the tenth (is derived) the fifth; its Rcosine is
the twenty-fifth. In that way from the twelfth (is calculated) the sixth and twenty-
fourth; from the sixth, the third and twenty-seventh; from the eighteenth, the ninth
and twenty-first. These are the only elements (of the table) of Rsines which can be
calculated in this way. So it has been observed that ‘only certain elements etc’. Next
the formula for the Rsine of half the difference of two arcs should be employed. Let
the fifth be the one Rsine and the ninth the other. From them will follow the second;
its Reosine is the twenty-eighth Rsine. From these two again by employing the
(previous) rule for the Rsine of semi-arcs from the square-root of the sum of the
squares of the Rsine and versed Rsine, the first and fourteenth (are obtained). The
remaining fourteen Rsines can also be computed in the same way.”

Bhaskara II has further given a rule for computing a trigonometrical table for
every degree. So it is called Pratibhagika-jyaka-vidhi (‘The rule for the Rsine of every
degree’’).

“Deduct from the Rsine of any arc its 6567th part; multiply its Reosine by 10
and then divide by 573. The sum of these two results is the next Rsine and their
difference the preceding Rsine. Here the first Rsine (i.e. Rsin 1°) will be 60’ and other
Rsines may be successively found. Thus in a circle of radius equal to 3438’, will be
found 90 Rsines.”?

Posterior Writers

Amongst the writers posterior to Bhaskara II (1150) who have given tables of
trigonometrical functions, the most notable are Mahendra Sari (1370) and Kamalakara
(1658). The latter has a table of Rsines and their differences for every degree of arc
of a circle of radius 60, while the former gives tables of Rsines and versed Rsines
together with their differences for every degree of the arc of a circle of radius 3600.
Mahendra Sari has furnished also some other tables for ready reckoning in Astronomy.
It is noteworthy that Mahendra Siri’s work, Yantrardja*, is admittedly based upon
some Arabic work. We are informed by his commentator Malayendu Siri, a direct
disciple of the author and who wrote his commentary only 12 years after the text,
that the author was the court astrologer of some potentate of the name of Firoz, who
is probably the famous Sultan Firoz Shah Tughluk of Delhi (1351-88 a.p.). The illus-
trations chosen will agree with this date.

6. INTERPOLATION
Function of any are

For finding the trigonometrical functions of an arc, other than those whose
values have been tabulated, the Hindus generally follow the principle of proportional
increase. Thus the Sarya-siddhdnta says:

“Divide the minutes (into which the given arc is first reduced) by 225; the quotient
will indicate the number of tabular Rsines exceeded; (the remainder) is multiplied
by the difference between the (tabular) Rsine exceeded and that which is still to be
reached and then divide by 225. The result thus obtained should be added to the
exceeded tabular Rsine; (the sum) will be the (required) direct Rsine. This rule is
applicable also to the case of (determining) the versed Rsine.”?

Brahmagupta states:

“Divide the minutes by 225, the quotient (will indicate) the number of tabular
Rsines (exceeded); the remainder is multiplied by the (next) difference of Rsines
and divided by the square of 15; the result is added to the (tabular) Rsine coresponding
to the quotient. Such (is the method) for finding the Rsine.”?

Such rules appear also in other astronomical works.?

The method of Maiijula (932) is very simple though it yields results only roughly
approximate. He says:

“The sum of the signes (in the given arc successively) multiplied by 4, 3 and 1
will give the degrees in the Rsines and Rcosines (to be found); such are the minutes.”

This rule though it appears to be cryptic has been fully explained by the com-
mentators; Prasastidhara (968), Paramesvara (1430) and Yallaya (1482). We shall
explain it with the help of a simple illustrative example: Suppose it is necessary to find
the Rsine of the angle 76° 30’. This angle can be written as 2 signs 16° 30’. Now the
tule says that for the first sign take 4 and for the second sign 3. For the third sign of
30° we are to take 1, so for a portion 16° 30’ of that sign we should take (164 x 1/30.
The sum of these 4, 3 and 33/60 will be the degrees in the required Rsine; and they
will also be the minutes of the required Rsine. Therefore

HINDU TRIGONOMETRY 91

Jya (76° 30’) =(4-+3+33/60) degrees+(4+3+33/60) minutes
=T° 40’ 33""

The rationale of this rule which has also been given by the earlier commentators, is
this: Majfijula considers the circle of reference to be of radius 488’ or in sexagesimal
notation 8° 8’; and his Table is very short:

Arcs Rsines Differences
a a 0’

4 4
30° 4 4

3° 3’
60° Pp

Pr? 1
90° 8° 8°

To find the Rsine of any intermediate arc he applies the principle of proportional
increase. And this at once leads to the rule.

Ares of Functions

The Hindus employed the principle of proportional increase also for the inverse
problem of finding the arc which has a given trigonometrical function different from
those tabulated. The Sirya-siddhanta says:

“Subtract the (nearest smaller tabular) Rsine (from the given Rsine) multiply
the remainder by 225 and divide by that difference (i.e. the difference corresponding to
the interval in which the given Rsine lies); the quotient added to the number
(corresponding to the tabular Rsine subtracted) multiplied by 225 will give the arc
(required).””?

Brahmagupta writes:

“Subtract the (nearest smaller tabular) Rsine (from the given Rsine); the re-
mainder is multiplied by 225 and divided by the (tabular) difference of Rsines; the

92 BIBHUTIBHUSAN DATTA AND AVADHESH NARAYAN SINGH

result should then be added to the product of the number corresponding to the sub-
tracted Rsine and the square of 15: (this will be) the arc (required).”?

Similarly in other works.*

Second Difference

The process explained above for calculating the trigonometrical functions of
a given arc or the arc having given trigonometrical functions, will yield results correct
only to a first degree of approximation in as much as the first difference alone of the
tabular Rsines has been employed? More accurate results will be obtained by
taking into consideration also the second (and higher) differences. The earliest Hindu
writer to do so was Brahmagupta. It is perhaps noteworthy that this more correct
method of interpolation does not occur in his bigger work, Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta,
which was composed in 628 A.D. but in his earlier monograph Dhyanagrahopadesa
as well as in his later work Khanda-Khddyaka written in 665 A.D. These latter works,
as has been stated before, contain a table of differences of Rsines for every arc of
15° in a circle of radius equal to 150. He says:

“Half the difference between the (tabular) difference passed over and that to be
passed is multiplied by (residual) minutes and divided by 900; half the sum of those
differences plus or minus that quotient according as it is less or greater than the
(tabular) difference to be passed, will be the (corrected) value of the difference to
be passed over.’

Suppose it is required to calculate the function—Rsine, Rcosine or versed
Rsine—of an arc «’. Let «,, 4,, <, be the three consecutive values of the argument in
the table such that <,>4,>4,.

*The roughness of the result is due also to other causes. Bhiskara II observes: “As much
large the radius of the circle is and into as many large number of (equal) arcs its quadrant is divided,
so much accurate will be the Rsines (calculated). Otherwise (the result) will be rough (sthiilay”.

In the rule A is stated to be 900, as it was formulated with a view at the table of the

the second sign only.

94 BIBHUTIBHUSAN DATTA AND AVADHESH NARAYAN SINGH

As has been observed by Bhaskara //' in the above formula one has to take
the negative sign in calculating the sine functions and the positive sign for the
versed Rsines. For in case of Rsine functions, the first difference continuously decreases
as the argument increases, while contrary is the case with the versed Rsine functions.

Ai + As

Therefore the mean value of any two differences ( ie. 3

) is greater than the

succeeding one (A,) in case of Rsine functions and less in case of versed Rsine
functions.

Brahmagupta’s method of interpolation appears also in the works of Majijula
(932) thus:

“(Find) half the sum of the tabular difference passed over and that to be passed;
half their difference is multiplied by the (remaining) degrees etc. and divided by
30; half the sum minus this quotient will be the coriected value of the difference
of (tabular) Rsines to be passed in the (calculations of the Laghu)—Manasa.’

The divisor is stated to be 30 in this rule, as Mafijula’s table of Rsines contains
values at intervals of 30° each.

Bhaskara IL (1150) writes:

“The difference of the (tabular) difference passed over and that to be passed
is multiplied by the remaining degrees and divided by 20; half the sum of the (tabular)
difference passed over and that to be passed minus or plus that quotient will be the
corrected value of the difference to be passed over in calculation here for Rsines
and versed Rsines.’’?

In formulating this rule Bhaskara II had in view a table calculated at intervals
of 10°. The rationale of the rule has been explained by him thus:

There is a bit of uncertainty about the authenticity of this verse. In the Calcutta University

Collection, there are three manuscripts of the Laghu-Manasa and four commentaries which contain
also the text. The commentary of Pragastidhara (958) is “copied from Ms. No. B 583 and compared
with other Mss in the Oriental Library, Mysore.” That by Paramesvara (1430) is “copied from a
palm leaf manuscript in Malayalam character belonging to the office of the curator for the publication
of Sanskrit Mss., Trivandrum.” The source of the commentary of Yallaya (1482) is not mentioned.
The above verse appears in the commentaries of Praastidhara and Yaliaya. But in the latter it has
been attributed to Maillikarjuna-siiri. Now this writer flourished about 1180 a.p. Thus he is posterior
to Pragastidhara by more than two centuries. So it is not possible for the latter to borrow
from the former. I think the mistake has been made by Yallaya. The verse in question seems to me
to be due in fact to Maiijula, and is more particularly from his Brhat-manasa, which is now lost.
Pragastidhara has quoted copiously from that work in his commentary of the Laghu-mdnasa without,
however, expressly mentioning it.

“Half the sum of the (tabular) difference passed over and that to be passed will
be the difference at the middle of those differences. But the difference to be passed
is at the end of that interval to be passed. Hence proportion (should be taken) with
their difference: If for an interval of 10°, we obtain half the difference of them, then
what will be obtained for (an interval of) the remaining degrees? Thus by the rule of
three, 20 will be the divisor of the product of the remaining degrees and the difference
of the (tabular) difference passed over and that to be passed. By the quotient is then
diminished half the sum of the (tabular) difference passed over and that to be passed;
for in the calculations of Rsines the differences are in the decreasing order. But in
the calculations of versed Rsines they are in the increasing order and hence the plus
in this case. Thus (the rule) is proved.”

This method of interpolation has been severely criticised by Kamalakara.1 But
he is wrong. Munisvara (1646) attempted to modify this method by iterating the process
but his process of iteration is in coriect as he has replaced the (tabular) difference to be
passed by the instantaneous difference, at every stage.*

The rationale of the rule can be shown with the help of trigonometry to be as
follows:

Ai=sin 4,—sin 4,=sin 4.—sin (4,—h)=sin 4, (I—cos h) + cos «,sin A).

Since A is small we can expand cos A and sin / in powers of A; then neglecting powers
higher than the second, we get

2
Ay = heosa, + S sina, .

2

Similarly, A, = h cos 4, = sin «, .

Atos = hos 4, and Ai Ar sin 4, .

Therefore, 5 3

Now, if «’ = «, +r, up to the second order of approximation, we have

Combining these two results we get Brahmagupta’s formula.

This method of interpolation has been applied also to the inverse problem of
finding the arc having a given trigonometrical function.

Brahmagupta says:

“To find the arc, multiply the residue (after subtracting as many Rsines from the
given quantity as possible) by 900 and divide by the difference to be passed after
having determined that difference by repeated operations. The degrees in the quotient
will be the arc of the residue. Subtract (as many possible) Rsines (from the given quan-
tity), multiply the residue by 900 and divide by the (next) difference not subtracted; the
quotient will be the second residue; multiply it by half the difference between the

HINDU TRIGONOMETRY 97

(tabular) difference passed over and that to be passed and then divide by 900. With
this quotient proceed as before for the (adjusted) value of the (tabular) difference to
be passed. Repeat the same operations with the residue until the result is obtained
finally.’*! (By “Rsines” in this rule is meant “tabular Rsine-differences.’”’)

The latter portion of this rule has become rather cryptic, as all the successive
operations have not been fully described. But it appears from the explanations of the
commentator Bhaftotpala (966) that Brahmagupta has intended the same formula as
has been clearly described by Bhaskara II. The latter says:

“Subtract the (tabular) differences (as many as possible from the given value);
multiply half the remainder by the difference of the (tabular) difference passed over
and that to be passed, and then divide by the (tabular) difference to be passed. Half
the sum of the (tabular) difference passed over and that to be passed plus or minus the
quotient is the adjusted value of the (tabular) difference to be passed, whence (will
follow) the arc (required).”’*

He then remarks as before that the negative sign should be taken in calculating
the Rsines and the positive sign for the versed Rsines.

The rationale of this will be clear from the previous formula on inversion. There
we shall now have f(«’) known and r (=- «’ —-4,) as unknown.

“This improved formula for calculating the arc is a little rough (sthii/a). Though
rough, it has been adopted for its simplicity (sukhdrtha). By other means such as finer
calculations or repeated applications it can be made more accurate.”!

Generalised Formula

Brahmagupta has extended his formula of interpolation so as to be applicable
also to the case when the intervals between the consecutive tabular values of the argu-
ment are not equal. He says:

“Multiply the increase of the Sighra anomaly to be passed by the degrees of the
increase of the Sighra equation passed over and divide by the increase of the Sighra
anomaly passed over; the quotient is the (adjusted) increase of the Sighra equation in
degrees. Multiply half the difference of that and the increase of the Sighra equation to
be passed by the residue of the anomaly and divide by the increase of the Sighra
anomaly to be passed; half the sum of these equations is decreased or increased by the
(last) quotient, according as it (half the sum) is greater or less than the Sighra equation
to be passed; the result will be corrected Sighra equation‘to be passed.”

7. SPHERICAL TRIGONOMETRY
Solution of Spherical Triangles

From the use in the treatment of astronomical problems, we find that the Hindus
knew how to solve spherical triangles, of oblique as well as of right-angled varieties.
They do not seem to possess a general method of solution in this matter unlike the
Greeks who systematically followed the method of Ptolemy (c. 150) based on the well-
known theorem of Menelaus (90). Still with the help of the properties of similar plane
triangles and of the theorem of the square of the hypotenuse, they arrived at a set of
accurate formulae sufficient for the purpose. As has been proved conclusively by
Sengupta!, Braunmiih] was wrong in supposing that in the matter of solution of
spherical triangles the Hindus utilised the method of projection contained in the
Analemma of Ptolemy.

Right-angled Spherical Triangle

The Hindus obtained the following formulae for the right-angled spherical
triangle, right-angled at C:

@) sin a==sin c sin A,

(ii) cos c=cos a cos b,
(iii) sin c cos A=cos a sin b,
(iv) sin b=tan a cot A,

(v) cos A=tan b cot c.

It should be particularly noted that as the tangent and cotangent functions are

centre is at O. Produce the sides AC and AB to P and Q respectively, such that the
arc AP=arc AQ=90°. Join PQ by an arc of the great circle on the sphere. Produce
the arcs CB and PQ so as to meet at the point Z.

Then clearly Z is the pole of the circle ACP as A is of the circle POZ. Join A,

small circle RVR’ perpendicular to OA, intersecting the preat circle SQN at D and

cut OA at O’. Again through O draw the straight line WOE parallel to DVD’. Draw
the great circle KEK’ W parallel to the small circle RBR’ and the great circle EAW

As an illustration of the application of the above formulae we take up the problem
of the determination of the relation between the zenith distance (z), azimuth () and
hour angle (#1) of a heavenly body of known declination(8) at a station whose terrestrial
latitude is $. In Fig. 15 let NEQS denote the horizon, NACS the meridian circle,
KEK’ the equator, RBR’ the diurnal circle of the heavenly body (B), AFE the six
o’clock circle, A the north pole and C the zenith. Then a=z, b=90°—¢, c=90°—8,
LA=H, C=.

Substituting these values in the formulae (ji), (i.1) and (ii), we obtain
cos z = sin 5 sin ¢ + cos 8 cos ¢ cos H

sin § = cos z sin ¢ + sin z cos ¢ Cos #,

106 BIBHUTIBHUSAN DATTA AND AVADHESH NARAYAN SINGH

and
sin z cos p=sin 6 cos ¢—cos 8 sin ¢ cos H.

These equations were obtained by most of the Hindu astronomers.! It should
however be made clear that the final results were arrived at by successive stages. The
straight line DVD’, the line of intersection of the diurnal circle with the horizon, is
technically called udaydsta-siitra (“the thread through the rising and setting points”),
BM is called Sanku (‘gnomon”); BH cheda or istahrti (“optional divisor’), MH
Sankutala, BG (=the jyd in the diurnal circle of the complement of the hour angle)
kala, GH (=the jyd of the arc of the diurnal circle intercepted between the horizon
and the six o’clock circle) Kujyd or ksitijya (“earth-sine”), HL(=jya ED) agra, ML
bahu, OM drgiya (‘“‘jyd of the zenith distance’’), the angle EAD cara (“‘the ascensional
difference”). The existence of these technical terms proves conclusively that the Hindus
actually made the constructions contemplated above. They recognise the angle MBH
to be equal to the latitude of the observer’s station.

The Sérya-siddhdnta says:

“The Rsine of the declination multiplied by the palabha (=12 tan 4) and divided
by 12 gives the kujyd (‘‘the earth-sine”); that multiplied by the radius and divided
by the radius of the diurnal circle will give the jy@ whose arc will be the cara

SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS AND SUMS OF
FRACTION-ADDITIONS USING SUTRA METHOD

(Received 22 July 1994)

Five sittra algorithms from Bharati Krsna Tirthaji’s system of Vedic
Mathematics are used to solve linear algebraic equations (in one, two, and three
variables) and find sums of certain types of fraction-additions. The propriety and
the controversy arising from the use of the word Vedic in the title are analyzed and
possible reasons for it are given. An etymological analysis of sitra and the five
siitra formulae is presented. The paper describes the salient features of this novel
mathematical system, explains the cryptic meanings of the five siitra formulae and
illustrates their procedures with examples. The examples cover equations with
integral, rational, irrational and mixed coefficients. A comparison of the number of
mathematical operations and the corresponding calculational time between the siitra
methods and the current theoretical methods shows that for the solution of the same
set of problems, the sitra methods are simpler and faster. Certain advantages of the
stitra methods over the present methods of doing numerical calculations are pointed
out. The many applications of the siitra pardvartya yojayet show how the cryptic
nature of these siitras can Jend them to many interpretations. Vedic Mathematics as
a Mathematical system is discussed and its educational potential pointed out. It is
suggested that Vedic Mathematics should form part of a course on numerical analysis
and the possibility of building a computer using these sitra algorithms should be
explored.

INTRODUCTION

This paper deals with the solution of linear algebraic equations in one, two, and
three variables and the determination of sums of fraction-additions using the sittra
method of the late Jagadguru Swami Sri Bharati Krsna Tirthaji Maharaja, former
Sankaracharya of Govardhana Matha, Puri!. Swamijt named his new theory and
method of calculation Vedic Mathematics or Sixteen Simple Mathematical Formulae
from the Vedas for One-line Answers to all Mathematical Problems. The applications
of these formulae and procedures to most classical mathematical problems lead to
extremely short solutions’. According to the author, he discovered these formulae
as a result of true realization by actual visualization of certain fundamental
mathematical truths, principles and relationships during his eight years of Tapas
(concentrated contemplation) in the forests surrounding Sringeri.

Although the present volume is the only work on mathematics that has been
left by Swamiji, he used to say that he had written sixteen volumes, one for each

530 S. DAS

siitra, He had deposited the manuscripts of the sixteen volumes at the house of one
of his disciples from where the manuscripts were lost irretrievably. Subsequently,
he re-wrote in 1957 — in one and half months — from his memory the present volume
which is a summary of the entire work with an introductory account of the sixteen
formulae. Swamijt had planned to write the other volumes too, but due to the
infirmity of old age and poor health, he could not complete the work. The typescript
of the present volume was left over by him in U.S.A. in 1958 for publication, and
he was to go to U.S.A. for correcting the proofs and supervising the printing
personally. But, after his return to India from the foreign tour, his health deteriorated
to such an extent that he could not go to U.S.A. Finally, after his expiry in 1960,
the typescript was brought back to India from U.S.A. posthumously. The present
introductory volume, which is the only work on mathematics that has been bequeathed
to posterity by SwAmiji, was first published in 1965 by the Banaras Hindu University,
India. All the other works on Vedic Mathematics are lost for good.

Tue Tite “Vepic MATHEMATICS”

The use of the word Vedic in the title of the book is quite misleading’. This
is because Vedic Mathematics signifies many different types of mathematical
activities pertaining to the Vedas* and the word Vedic gives the impression that the
work belongs to ancient Vedic Mathematical System, and all that the author has
done is to acquire them through the usual process of laborious research. But these
sitras are, till now, not found in any of the present recensions of the Atharvaveda.
Further, the style of the sittras, which are in Sanskrit language, indicates that they
do not belong to the Vedic period. The contents of the book also indicate that the
sitras are unlikely to be from the Vedas. For instance, topics like differentiation,
integration, conjugate hyperbolas and asymptotes were not known in Vedic times.
Nonetheless, SwAmiji used to say that the siitras are contained in the Parisista (the
appendix portion) of the Atharvaveda. This inconsistency makes us think that,
perhaps, some of the basic materials of Vedic Mathematics are available in the
Vedas which Bharati Krisna retrieved, synthesized and then composed them in sitra
form in modern Sanskrit using his erudition in Sanskrit language, his knowledge of
mathematical terminology gleaned from Sanskritic scientific literature and his
scholarship in present-day mathematics. This conjecture of ours is corroborated by
Smt. Manjula Devi Trivedi who has stated that the siitras were, perhaps, reconstructed
on the basic of intuitive revelation from materials scattered here and there in the
Atharvaveda’. In any case, the claimed source and antiquity of the work, as suggested
by the title of the book, appear to be untrue and remain a puzzle to the scholars.
It is difficult to say as to why Swamiji chose such a title, but it is possible that he
was guided by the following considerations? :

(a) Swamiji wanted to give a sensational title;

(b) He wanted to show his reverential approach towards the Vedas as well as his
loyalty to the religious order of which he was one of the Chiefs;

SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS AND SUMS 531

(c) He wanted to show that he accepted the supreme authority of the Vedas;

(d) There, always, has been a tendency in the traditional Hindu orthodoxy of this
country to mystify things and give them religious colourings, particularly when
it came to creative works. This, perhaps, is done to give the work a stamp of
authority and a greater credibility. The Indian literature abounds in legends
which give a divine basis to anything creative;

(e) The Vedas or Srutis are believed to be the words of Brahma. This mass of
knowledge, ‘ever the same yet changing ever’ was discovered directly based
on integral experiences by Aryan personages called Rsis who were seers of
thoughts®. This knowledge is inaccessible to mankind to-day because we lack
a sound understanding of the Vedic scientific techniques and also, because of
our incomplete knowledge of Vedic Sanskrit. It is not unlikely that there is a
Master Key hidden somewhere — may be in the Vedas themselves - by which
it is possible to unravel these secrets. The language barrier has come on the
way of our getting at the true meanings of words and we are unable to get
proper modern versions of statements which may contain important scientific
truths. Even though, real scientific works of those times like the Deva Vidya
and the Bhiita-Vidya are no longer extant, a large number of statements on
important topics are still found scattered in Vedic literature’*. Viewed in this
broader perspective and understood in this deeper way, the title Vedic
Mathematics may seem justified.

(f) There is also the possibility that a secret version of Atharvaveda exists in the
oral form and Swamiji had knowledge about it.

Whatever it may be, as far as we are concerned, our interest in Vedic
Mathematics springs from its scientific content, its intrinsic merit as a delightfully
original mathematical system, and also, because of the important place it holds in
the twentieth century mathematical history’.

Main Features OF SWAMisi’s VEDIC MATHEMATICS

Vedic Mathematics forms a self-contained, self-consistent mathematical system
and can be considered an alternative formulation of mathematics using the siitra
style. It has the merit of originality and forms a class by itself. The system consists
of a set of highly cryptic mathematical propositions coded into 16 sitras (brief
aphorisms) and 13 upa(sub)-sitras (corollaries). They provide, in condensed form,
techniques for solving a large variety of problems in mathematics such as:
multiplication, division, decimal fractions, the value of 1, the Pythagorean theorem,
simple differentiation, etc. The derivations of these sitras demonstrate great power
of insight or intuition on the part of the author, as it has not been possible so far
to derive the siitras and their corollaries, the sub-siitras by any method of reasoning.
A list each of these sitras and their sub-siitras is given in Appendix 1 and Appendix

532 S. DAS

2 respectively.

The system is essentially computational in nature. Its axiomatic approach to
numerical computations results in the shortening of mathematical processes a great
deal, providing, thereby, fast algorithmic devices capable of doing rapid computations
with a speed and an accuracy comparable to or even better than the symbolic
method, By avoiding operations with large numbers, the burden of calculations is
lighened and the chances of committing numerical errors are reduced. The
mathematical processes, however, involve quite a bit of mental calculation'®.

As a computational technique, the siitra methods of Vedic Mathematics can
furnish results upto any degree of accuracy. For example, in finding the complete
decimal equivalent of the vulgar fraction 1/49, a computer may fail to give the
answer, but the siitra method gives the correct result in one step!'.

The theorems and the corollaries are highly compact and comprise of just 45
words, 24 for the siitras and 21 for the sub-siitras. Couched in Sanskrit language,
these words are either single or compound, but mostly one or two compound words.
The siitras are elegant and possess in them the rhyme and beauty of Sanskrit poetry.
They are also simple to remember, easy to understand and easy to apply.

The cryptic nature of the siitras and the sub-sitras lend them to many
interpretations, and the same sutra can have applications in more than one area of
mathematics.

The siitras provide inherent secrecy, and may, therefore, be suitable for military
applications.

Surras, Upa-siTRAS AND THEIR GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF APPLICATIONS!?

The Sanskrit word siitra (a1) is derived from the root siv meaning to ‘sew’
and literally means a thread or a string. In figurative sense, it means that which like
a thread runs through or holds together everything : a rule, a direction, a short
sentence or aphoristic rule. In a broader sense, it means any work or manual which
consists of strings of such rules hanging together like threads, or the name of a
book. Siitra is used in the singular to denote both a name for a whole collection of
rules, and as a name for a single siitra. Panini’>*, the great grammarian always used
siitra in the sense of a whole collection of rules and not as an expression for a single
siitra. The use of the word siitra as the name for a book might, in all likelihood,
have come from the ancient Indian practice of writing on palm-leaves, piercing
them and keeping them together by means of a ‘string’. This is analogous to the
present-day practice of binding a book by putting together pages (leaves). Sitra
form of literature is characterized by great economy of words (high information
density) and an artificial, enigmatic form. This minimizes space requirement for
storing information and makes learning and transmission of knowledge easy. Sitra

SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS AND SUMS 533

style is unique to Indian literary tradition and has no parallel ‘in the entire literature
of the world’ (Winternitz). The word Upa in Sanskrit is used as a preposition or
prefix to verbs and nouns. When prefixed to a noun, it expresses direction towards,
nearness, contiguity in space, time, number, degree and relationship but with the
idea of subordination and inferiority. In the context of Vedic Mathematics, a siitra,
therefore, means a general rule or formula and an upa(sub)-siitra means a corollary
which provides for special cases or particular types. Vedic Mathematics signifies
either the book or simply a collection of rules with each siitra signifying a truth or
theory briefly stated. The power, the simplicity and the quickness of these sitra
formulae lie in the fact that they are statements of general principles which take
specific meanings depending upon the situation. We explain this by an example.
The ninth sitra in Vedic Mathematics is : calana-kalanabhyam which literally means
‘By differentiation’. This formula is a general statement as such; but its fuller form
when applied to the solution of quadratic equations is'’ ; Calita-kalita vargo vivecakah
which means ‘The square (varga) of the differential coefficient (calita-kalita) is
(equal to) the discriminant (vivecaka)’. Therefore, according to this rule, the solution
of the quadratic equation ax*+bx+c=0 is given by (2ax+b)? = b’-4ac which yields
the correct solution. Here, (2ax+b) is the differential coefficient of the left-hand
side of the quadratic equation and (b?—4ac) is its discriminant.

The general principle of applications of the siitra formulae of Vedic Mathematics
is to look for and spot certain characteristics in a given problem, identify the type,
and then use the siitra which is most appropriate. If the problem has certain additional
and typical characteristics, it becomes a special case and the upa-sitra or sub-siitra
is applied instead. The general formula is resorted to only if no special case is
involved. Usually, the general formulae are longer than the special ones.

Tue Etymococy oF THe Five Sirra AvcoritHMs!?

In the present investigations, the five algorithms to be used are in the form of
four siitras and one sub-siitra. The four siitras are :

aera ant (paravartya yojayet) which cryptically means “Transpose and adjust”;

areal WIAA (4nuriipye siinyam anyat) which means “If one is in ratio, the
other one is zero”;

PHeraAsoArAy (sankalana-vyavakalanabhyam) which means “By addition and
by subtraction”;

BRETT (sopantya-dvayam antyam) whose cryptic meaning is “The ultimate
and twice the penultimate”.

The one sub-siitra is :

534 S. DAS

@TART (antyayor eva) whose meaning is “Only the last terms”.

The first sitra paravartya yojayet consists of one single word (yojayet) and one
compound word (paravartya). The word paravartya is a blending of two words:
para and vartya. Para is used as a prefix to nouns and verbs, and indicates ‘off, aside
or away’. Vartya is derived from the root Vrt and literally means ‘to be turned back
or reversed or exchanged’. Hence, paravartya means ‘Having transposed’, The
literal. meaning of yojayet is “You should join’. It is a verb form of the word yuj
meaning ‘to join, to insert, to unite, to connect, to combine, to bring together’. In
astronomy, it means ‘to come into conjunction with’. In mathematics it can mean
add, subtract, multiply, etc. Hence, the siitra is translated in a general way as:
“Transpose and adjust”. The second siitra anuripye sinyam anyat means “If one is
in ratio, the other one is zero”. The word Anuriipye is a single one and literally
means ‘If in proportion’. Sinyam anyat is a compound word consisting of the two
words : Sinyam, i.e., zero and anyat, i.e., the other one. In the third siitra sankalana-
vyavakalanabhyam, the word sankalana is derived from the root kal and means ‘By
addition’ and vyavakalana means ‘By subtraction’. The ending -bhyam comes from
rule of grammar and denotes a dual number. It implies that the twin processes of
addition and subtraction should be performed simultaneously. It may be pointed out
that in Aryabhatiya-Bhasya, the word sarnkalani is used to mean the sum of a series
of natural numbers'*. The fourth siitra sopantya dvayam antyam is one compound
word consisting of three words : sopantya meaning ‘The penultimate (last but one)’,
dvayam meaning ‘Twice’ and antyam meaning ‘The ultimate (last one)’. The sub-
siitra antyayoreva is a combination of the two words eva and antyayoh which are
blended, by a rule of euphonic combination, to form the compound word antyayor
eva. Antyayoh is a gen. form of the word antya meaning ‘Last in place, in time or
in order’. It also denotes the last number of a mathematical series. As an example,
the noun antyamiila in arithmetic means the last or greatest root. The word eva is
most freqeently used to strengthen an idea expressed by another word, here antyayoh.
It means ‘exactly, same, only, alone, immediately on’ and so forth. It implies
emphasis, affirmation, etc.

In what follows, we shall start with the simplest of the linear algebraic equations
and then progressively go to the more difficult ones.

PaRAVARTYA YOJAYET SUTRA AND ITS APLICATIONS

One of the most versatile of the siitras in the system of Vedic Mathematics is
the Sitra paravartya yojayet. Its underlying principle of application, when applied
to the solution of algebraic equations, is : gather all the terms involving the single
real variable (say, x) to the left side of the equation and all the independent terms
to the right side of the equation with the condition that every transposition during
the process produces a sign inversion, i.e., ‘+’ becomes “x?

es

and vice versa; ‘x
becomes ‘+’ and vice versa. This reduces the number of transposition operations.

SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS AND SUMS 535

Equations of the form ax+b = cx+d

This is the commonest type of equation which is solved by transposition. It
follows from what has been said above that

x = (d-b)/(a-c) qd)
Problem 1

2x+7 = 13x-10. Therefore, x = (-10-7)/(2-13) = -17/-11 = 17/11

Equations of the form (ax+b)/(cx+d) = p/q

x = (pd-bq)/(aq-cp) (2)

Under the restrictive condition that p=q, eq. (2) reduces to eq. (1).
Problem 2

(21x+2)/(5x+9) = 6/7. Therefore, x = (54-14)/(147-30) = 40/117

Equations of the form (x+a) (x+b) = (xtc) (x+d)

This is another common type of equation in which both sides of the eqation
contain two binomial factors of degree one each. Using the paravartya sutra, we
immediately write

x = (cd-ab)/(a+b—c-d) (3)

= 0 if cd=ab, i.e., the product of the absolute terms are the same on both
sides.

Problem 3
(V19x+1) (V19x+11) = (V19x+13) (V19x+6)
Therefore, V19x = (78-11)/(12-19) = -67/7 => x = -67/7V19
Equations of the form m/(x+a) + n/(x+b) = 0
Application of the paravartya sitra gives

x = —(bm+an)/(m+n) (4)

536 S. DAS
Problem 4

2/{(13x/3)-1] + 1/£(13x/3)+3] = 0

Therefore, 13x/3 = -(6-1)/(2+1) = -5/3 =» -5/13

The above procedure can be extended to equations having any number of terms
provided a suitable condition is imposed so that the order of the equation does not
exceed unity. For example. in the equation

m/(x+a) + n/(x+b) + p/(x+c) = 0,

which has three terms, we can write

x = —(mbe + nea + pab) / [m(b+c) + n(atc) + p(a+b)],

provided that m+n+p = 0. Otherwise, the equation becomes a quadratic in x.

Merger type of simple equations

These refer to equations of the type

=, p/(xta,) = r/(x+b)

Single step merger

The method is applicable to equations in which the sum of the numerators on
the LHS equals the single numerator on the RHS, ie., 2, p, = r. The procedure
consists in merging the fraction on the RHS into the LHS and equating the RHS
to zero till the equation contains only two terms. This derived equation is solved
for x. Merging is accomplished by subtracting the independent term (b) of the
binomial on the RHS from the absolute terms (a, ’s) of the binomials on the left,
and then multiplying these results by their corresponding numerators (p, ’s)
successively. The results so obtained become the new numerators of the fractions
on the LHS, the denominators remaining unchanged. The simplest among these
types of equations is where there are only two terms on the LHS, i.e., the equation
is of the form

p,/(x+a,) + p,/(xta,) = r/(x+b)
Problem 5

5/(x-2) + 7/(x+4) = 12/(x-9)

Since, p,+p, = 12 = 1, the sitra applies and the derived equation is

SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS AND SUMS 537

S{-2-(-9) /(x-2) + 7[4-(-9)V(x+4) = 0

or, 35/(x-2) + 91/(x+4) = 0 Or, 5/(x-2) + 13/(x+4) = 0

Using eq. (4), we get

x = -[(4) (5) + (-2) (13) (5413) = —(20-26)/18 = 6/18 = 1/3
Disguises

These refer to equations which are not readily seen to be of the single step
merger type. They are of two kinds: (i) Co-efficients of x equal; and (ii) Co-
efficients of x unequal. To solve such equations, first the applicability of the
paravartya siitra is tested. This is done by equalising the x-coefficients in the
denominator — if necessary ~ using the LCM method, and then dividing the numerator
of each term by the corresponding x-coefficient in the denominator. If the sum is
the same on both sides of the equation, the siitra applies. The equation is then
written in its proper form and we proceed as before. We demonstrate the procedure
by solving an equation in which the co-effieients of x are unequal. The equation
where x-coefficients are equal is a special case of this.
Problem 6

QKN3x-1) + SUN2x+7) = (2N245V3)/(V6x49)

Equalising the x-coefficients in the denominator,

2N24N6x—N2) + 5V3/(V6x+7V3) = (2V2+5V3)/(V6x49)

LHS = 2V2/V6 + 5V3/N6 = (2V2+5V3)/V6 and RHS = (2V2+5V3)/V6

Equality is satisfied. Therefore, applying the siitra, we get

2N2(-V2-9)/(V6x—V2) + 5V3(7V3-9)(VOX+7V3) = 0

Using eq. (4), we get

V6x = -[14V6(-V2-9)-5V6(7V3~9)/[2V2(-V2-9)+5V3(7V3-9)]

= ~V6(—14V2-126-35V3+45)/(~4-18V2+105-45V3)
= ~V6(-81-14V2-35V3)/(101-18V2-45V3)

J X= (81414V2+35V3)(101-18V2~45V3)

538 S. DAS
Multiple step merger

The single step merger method as described above can be extended to equations
having more than two terms on the LHS. The procedure is a repeated application
of the method of single step merger.
Problem 7

Al(2x-1) + 27/(3x-1) + 125/(5x-1) = 144/(4x-1)

Equalising the x-coefficients in the denominator, and then dividing throughout
by 60, we get

2/(60x-30) + 9/(60x-20) + 25/(60x—12) = 36/(60x-15)

LHS = 2/60 + 9/60 + 25/60 = 36/60 = RHS

By merger, the derived equation is

—30/(60x-30) + [-45/(60x-20)] + 75/(60x-12) = 0

Or, 2/(60x-30) + 3/(60x-20) = 5/(60x~-12)

LHS = 2/60 + 3/60 = 5/60 = RHS. Therefore, again by merger
~36/(60x-30) + [-24/(60x-20)] = 0

Or, 3/(60x-30) + 2/(60x—20) = 0

Using eq. (4), we get

60x = —[(-20)3-(30)2/(3+2) = -(-120/5) = x = 2/5

The above merger method can be generalized to solve merger type of simple
equations having any number of terms on the LHS. The general merger formula is

[p,(a,-b) ..... (a,-a,) (a,-a,) (a,-a,)/(x+a,)
+[p,(a,-b) ..... (a,-a,) (a,-a,) (a,~a,)/(xta,) = 0

and the general solution is

x = -[a,p,(a,-b) ..... (a,-a,) (a,-a,) (a,-a,)
+a,p,(a,—b) ..... (a,-a,) (a,-a,) (a,-a,))/
[p,(a,-b) ..... (@,-a,) (a,-a)) (a,-a,)
+P,(2,-) ... (aya) (a,-a,) (@,-a,)]

SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS AND SUMS 539

Applying these formulae to Problem 5, the final derived equation is
5(-2+9)/(x-2) + 7(449)/(x+4) = 0 Or, 5/(x-2) + 13/(x+4) = 0
and the solution is

x = -[4(5) (-2+9) + (-2) (7) (4+9))/[5(-2+9) + 7(4+9)]
= —(20.7-2.7.13/(7.5+7.13) = -(20-26)/(5+13) = -(-6)/18 = 1/3

Complex merger

We now discuss equations which contain two terms on each side and the
coefficients of x are not all equal. The procedure is as follows :

Step 1 Check if £(N/C,) is the same on both sides of the equation. Here, N;
denotes the numerator and C, the x-coefficient in the denominator of the

ith fraction.

Step 2 If the above condition is satisfied, equalise the x-coefficient by the LCM
method to obtain the derived equation.

Step 3. Arrange the equation in such a way that the numerator on both sides of
the final derived equation is the same.

Step 4 If we pass the above three tests, Paravartya sitra becomes applicable and
we write,

2 2

Step 5 Solution of the equality in Step 4 furnishes the value for x.
Problem 8

Therefore, we equalise the x-coefficients and obtain the derived equation as

204/(12x+20) — 204/(12x+33) = 156/(12x-45) — 156/(12x-28)

540 S. DAS
N on LHS = 204 x 13 = 12 x 17x 13

N on RHS = 156 x 17

W

12x 17x 13

Therefore, the above equation is the final derived equation and the paravartya
stra is applicable. We write

(12x+20) (12x+33) = (12x-45) (12x—28)

Using eq. (3), we obtain

12x = (45x28 - 20x33)/(53+73) = 600/126 = x = 25/63
Simultaneous simple equations

For the solution of simultaneous equations of the type

ax + by = c}
px + ay =r},

methods that are currently in use are the cross-multiplication method and the
substitution or elimination method. Of the two, the former is less time consuming
than the latter. But, it sufferes from the drawback arising due to a confusion
in the sign convention. Consequently, for the majority of the problems, the
elimination method is followed.

We shall, here, discuss for the solution of simple simultaneous equations of all
types a general rule from the system of Vedic Mathematics. The rule is an application
of the paravartya siitra and is a cyclic one. Its advantages are: it does not suffer
from the short-comings of the current methods as mentioned above, and entails less
time and labour.

(i) To determine the value of x, cross-multiply the y-coefficients and the
independent terms first forward, i.e., rightward and then backward, i.e., leftward.
This gives the numerator. The denominator is obtained by going from the y-coefficient
in the upper row across to the x-coefficient in the lower row first backward and then
forward.

“x = (br-cq)/(bp—aq)

(ii) To determine the value of y, follow the cyclic system, i.e., start with the
independent term on the upper row towards the x-coefficient on the lower row and
then the x-coefficient in the upper row towards the independent term on the lower
row to get the numerator. The denominator is invariably the same as for x.

Fractional equations of the type

expressed as a product of binomials which are in cyclic order.

ANURUPYE §UNYAM ANYAT SUTRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS

If the simultaneous equations are such that the ratio of the coefficients of one
of the unknown quantities is equal to the ratio of the independent terms, the above
sitra tells us to set the second unknown quantity equal to zero. Consequently, the
term containing the first unknown quantity is equated to the absolute term on the
right.

Here, (V7/4)/V7 = 1/4 and 15/60 = 1/4. Hence, by the above rule

Therefore, V7y = 60 => y = 60/N7
Solution of the above problem clearly demonstrates that the sitra method avoids
multiplication of numbers. The procedure should, therefore, be particularly useful
while dealing with simultaneous simple equations involving large numbers as the
problem below shows.

Problem 13

499x + 172y.= 212}
9779x + 387y = 477}

It-is noted that

SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS AND SUMS 543

212/477 = (4x53)/(9x53) = 4/9
172/387 = (4x43)/(9x43) = 4/9

Hence, it follows that x = 0
Therefore, 172y = 212 = y = (4x53)/(4x43) = 53/43
The above procedure can be extended to equations having any number

of unknown quantities. Consider the following set of three equations in three
variables.

Problem 14
97 x + ay + 43 z= am)
49979 x + by + (ptq) z= bm}

49(a-d)> x + cy + (m-n) z = cm}
In the first two equations, ay/by=a/b and am/bm=a/b
In the last two equations, by/cy=b/c and bm/cm=b/c
x = 0 and z = 0. Consequently, ay =am => y=m
THE SANKALANA-VYAVAKALANABHYAM SUTRA
If the simultaneous linear equations are such that the x and the y-coefficients
are found interchanged, their solutions can easily be arrived at by the application

of the above siitra. The method consists in adding and subtracting the equations
repeatedly.

Problem 15
(23/2)x ~ V4ly = 105}
V41x  - (23/2)y = 99}

Addition gives, [(23/2) + V41] [xy] = 204 Or, x-y = 408/(23+2V41)
Subtraction gives, [(23/2) — V41] [xty] = 6 Or, xty = 12/(23-2V41)
Repetition of the above process gives

2x = 408/(23+2V41) + 12/(23-2V41)

= (408x23+12x23-816V414+24V41)/(23x23-4x4 1)
= (23x420-792V41)/(529-164) > x= (4830-3964 1)/365

544 S. DAS

Substituting for x in the second equation, we get
~(23/2)y = 99-V41x = 99-V41(4830-396V41)/365
= (36135~4830V4 1+16236)/365 = (52371-4830V41)/365
Therefore, y = 2(4830V41-52371)23x365) = (420V41-4554)/365

We thus see that even if the coefficients are fairly large and complex, elaborate
multiplication, subtraction and division are avoided.

THE SOPANTYA-DVAYAM ANTYAM SUTRA
This sitra is used to solve equations of the type
1QCIQ.CO + VQWQ,C0 = 1QWQ(X) + 1/Q,0)Q,(x) (GS)

where, Q(x), Q,(x), Q,(x), Q,(x) are polynomial factors of degree one and are in
arithmetic progression. The sitra tells us to obtain the value of x from the equation

L+2P = 0

where, L is the ultimate or the last polynomial factor, i.e., Q,(x) and P is the
penultimate or the last but one factor which is Q,(x).

Problem 16

1/(3x?+5x+2) + 1/(5x?+8x+3) = 1/(7x?+11x+4) + 1/(15x?+19x+6)
Or, 1/(x+1)(3x+2) + 1/(x+1)(5x+3) = 1/(x+1)(7x+4) + 1/(3x+2)(5x+3)
Here, Q(x) = x+1, Q\(x) = 3x42, Q,00) = 5x+3 and Q,(x) = 7x+4

are all polynomial factors of degree one and are in arithmetic progression with a
common difference of 2x+1. Therefore, all the conditions are satisfied and the sitra
applies. We write

(7x+4)+2(5x+3) 0 Or, x=(-~6~4)/(7+10)=-10/17 [By eq. (1)]

In this problem, the equation is actually a quadratic. It has been specifically
chosen to show that the formula sopantya-dvayam antyam is applicable to both
linear and quadratic equations. In the latter case, however, the siitra gives only one
solution correctly (x=-10/17 in the present case). The other solution is x=—-1/2 (see
p. 44, Annexure 3). Applicability of the formula to linear equations is obvious.

ANTYAYOREVA SuB-SUTRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS

We now discuss various types of miscellaneous linear equations which are
amenable to solution by the siitra formula antyayoreva.

EQUuATIONS OF THE TYPE IN WHICH THE RATIO OF THE NUMERATOR TO THE DENOMINATOR
ON THE LHS (EXCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT TERMS) EQUALS THE RATIO OF THE ENTIRE

NUMERATOR TO THE ENTIRE DENOMINATOR ON THE RHS

In such situations, the siitra tells to equate the absolute terms on the LHS to
the quantity on the RHS and then solve the equation.

Problem 17

[O/2)4NSP(X/3)4NTP = (9x+36V5)/(4x4+24V7)
Ratio on the LHS (excluding the independent terms)

= [(x7/4)4-V5x]/[(x2/9)+(2V7/3)x]

= (x+4V5)9/4(x+6V7) = (9x+36V5)/(4x+24V7) = RHS
Therefore, the rule applies and we write

5/7 = (9x+36V5)/(4x+24V7)

Using eq. (2), we get

x = (5x24V7-7x36V5)/(9x7-4x5) = (120V7-252V5)/43
Fraction-additions of the type where the factors in the denominators are either in
Arithmetic Progression or are related to one another in a special manner as in
Summation of Series.

The factors of the denominators in the fractions can either only be the
independent terms or only the x-coefficients or may consist of both. Sums of such
series are readily obtainable by the Antyayoreva sitra which is here interpreted as
follows. The sum of this series is a fraction whose numerator is the sum of the
numerators in the series, and denominator is the product of the two ends, i.e., the
first and the last binomials. The rule applies indefinitely to as many terms and to
as many varieties as one may please.

Problem 18

V/(X2+X+1)(24+2K42) + V/(K2+2K+2)(X7E+3KAB) t eececrecreeeseeeereeses

The siitra applies and the sum of the first four terms is
S, = Cl+14+141)/(2+x+1)(x?24+5x4+5) = 4/(x?+x+1)(x?+5x+5)

In this problem, the denominators are quadratics and the progression is with regard
to both the x-coefficient and the absolute term.

Problem 19!”
V/(1+x)(14+2x) + 1/11+2x)(143x) + 1/1143x)(144x) 4 eee

It is easily seen that the sitra applies and the nth term being equal to
1/{1+nx][{1+(n+1)x], we write the sum to n terms (S_) of the above series as

S, = (+1414... to n terms)/(1+xJ[1+(n+1)x] = n/{1+x)[1+(n+1)x]

write the sum to n terms (S,) of the infinite series as :

The sitra applies and we write the sum of the first four fractions as

Equations of the type where each numerator is the difference of the two binomial
factors in its denominator.

This type of fraction-additions are met with in Summation of Series and can be
tackled with the same Antyayoreva formula. The sum of the series is a fraction
whose numerator is the difference of the two ends, i.e., the first and the last
binomial factors in the denominator, and the denominator is the product of the same
two ends.

Problem 22

3/70 + 9/190 + 27/874 +99/6670 + 0... seein
This is rewritten as
= ~(7-10)/(7x10) — (10-19)/(10x19) - (19-46)/(19x46)
(46-145 )/(46X145) - eens

Applying the antyayoreva siitra, we write the first (7) and the last (145) terms to
obtain the sum of the first four fractions as :

S, = -(7-145)/(7x145) = 138/1015

The following two points may be noted in this problem:

(i) If the last term were 7 instead of 145, we would get the sum
S, = ~(-7)(7x7) = 0

(ii) As in the LHS, the RHS (138/1015) also has the characteristic property that the
numerator (138) is the difference of the two binomial factors (7 and 145) in
the denominator.

Problem 23
(a-b)/(px+a)(px+b) + (b-c)/(px+b)(px+c) + (c-d)/(px+C)(PX+) + ween

It is seen that the numerator in each fraction is the difference of the tw@binomial
factors in the denominator. Therefore, we write

S, = [(px+a)-(px+d)]/(pxt+a)(px+d) = (a—d)/(px+a)(px+d)

Solutions of the problems above clearly show that the siitra method avoids the
tiresome procedure of finding the LCM, the multiplicatioris, the divisions, the
additions, the cancellations, etc.

Discussions AND CONCLUSIONS

The methods of solving linear algebraic equations and of finding sums of
certain types of fraction-additions using the siitra algorithms of Vedic Mathematics
have been discussed and the unique features of the system described. We have seen
how the simple techniques of Vedic Mathematics for doing algebraic computations
give quick results. We now discuss Vedic Mathematics as a mathematical system.

The first of these is its utilitarian aspect as a fast computational tool. In Table
1, we present comparisons of the number of operations performed and the
corresponding calculational time between the current methods and the siitra methods
for the problems dealt with in this paper. The operations included in the counting
were ; cancellations and collections of like terms, transpositions, extraction of
common factors, and finding the LCM in addition to the fundamental mathematical
operations. The calculational time given are the real time, i.e., the clock time. In
all, 23 problems were solved. In problems 3 and 6, the co-efficients in the equation
are irrational numbers, in problem 4 the co-efficients are rational numbers, in
problem 15 the co-efficients are both rational and irrational, in problems 9, 12, 17
the co-efficients are of mixed type, and problems 14, 20, 23 are of general types
of equations. In rest of the problems, the co-efficients are integers.

It is seen from Table 1 that the ration (t/t,) of the two computational times
ranges mostly from about 1.2 to about 15. In four problems (18, 21, 22, 23) using
the Antyayoreva formula, this ratio is around 14 and in problem 20 it is as much
as 20. In one application (problem 14) of the anuriipye Sunyam anyat sitra, t/t.-17.
These results demonstrate that the sitra algorithms are much faster than the current
methods. Let us now compare this time-ratio with the corresponding ratio (N/N,)
of the number of operations. We observe that, in the majority of the cases, the
reductions in computational time by sitra methods follow closely the corresponding
reductions in the number of operations. However, in a few cases (Problems 14, 18,
20 to 23), the pattern is different. Here, the gain in calculational speed, as one goes
from current methods to the sitra methods, is much more than the corresponding
savings in the number of operations would suggest. For instance, in problem 14, N,
is only one-fifth of N but the siitra method is about 17 times faster than the current
method. This highlights the shortness and the simplicity of the processes involved
in the siitra methods. In problem 10, difference in the number of operations between
the two methods is marginal, but not so the difference in the calculational time. In
problem 12, the number of operations, when the general rule is used, is more in
stra method than in the current method as a result of which the siitra method is
considerably slower. This was because the general siitra formulae for determining
x and y were used as such. But, when the value of x=0 obtained using the general
siitra formula was substituted in one of the simultaneous equations (19x+V7y=60)
to determine y instead of calculating it from the general sitra formula, the sitra
method was found to be as fast (40 sec) as the current method. This is shown by
an asterisk mark in the third row under problem 12. The large values of t, obtained
in problems 14 to 17, 20, 22 (LCM) and 23 (LCM) are either due to the current
methods being much longer or because larger-digit numbers are involved in the
calculation or both. It is interesting to note that in problem 15 for the solution of
simultaneous equations, the general formula takes less time (180 sec) than the
special formula (240 sec). These results and observations show that Vedic
Mathematics is usually much better when working with special types of equations
than with the general ones. This means that one should be discrete in using the
general formulae and use them only when the equations do not possess the

550 S. DAS

characteristic(s) that make one of the special formulae applicable. The values of
t/t, quoted in Table | are on the lower side and are likely to increase owing to the
following reasons. First, our experience of working with Vedic Mathematics is very
little at the moment. With greater use, t, will further decrease. Second, in Vedic
Mathematics, mental calculations play quite a significant role in the mathematical
processes. Consequently, many of the mathematical operations and steps that the
author wrote can be skipped. This would considerably decrease t,. Third, t,, on an
average, will increase when the problems are worked out by students. This is shown
in the fifth column of Table | under the heading CT. They were worked out by
Varsha'® using the conventional methods (See Appendix 3). It is seen that the
increase in CT over t, is by a factor ranging from | to 5. These results are
sufficiently encouraging to prompt one explore the possibility of developing soft-
ware based on these sitra algorithms for use in high speed computers'??! or in
Personal Computers**. The possibility of modifying existing programs written for
the solution of problems of applied nature or popular commercial software such as
the Mathematica”** can also be explored. In an earlier paper!!, we demonstrated the
possibility of fruitfully incorporating some of these sitra algorithms into modern
computers. For this, the square root of the number 119716 was evaluated using both
the siitra method and the Library Function SQRT(X). It was found that even if the
sitra algorithm was programmed in Fortran Language, the average execution time
was same in both the cases, namely, 31 milliseconds. The process of developing
soft-ware using the siitra algorithms may spark off clue(s) to the development of a
new programming language. Finally, efforts may be made to build a computer using
the sitra algorithms of Vedic Mathematics. It is important to point out that speed
may not always be the most important criterion in making a choice of an algorithm.
The ease with which a calculation can be performed may be of greater importance
in many situations. In such cases, Vedic Mathematics can become very handy by
lightening the burden of computations.

The second aspect of Vedic Mathematics is the mathematical one. Swami
Bharati Krsna has said that the siitras apply to all mathematical problems'. But,
since only one volume on the subject has survived, there is incentive to delve
deeper into the subject and see how the areas of applicability of the siitra formulae
can be widened, and more results are derived using the existing formulae or more
of similar results are developed*>*°, The present investigation is a modest attempt
in this direction. This study can be further extended to the field of complex numbers
and a comparison of their computational efficiencies with the current numerical
techniques can be made. Extension or modification of the relevant siitra algorithm(s)
to find sums of mathematically divergent series, which occur in the computation of
Dirac’s atomic hydrogen wave functions of the continuum, may also prove to be
interesting. The late Prof. Bhatnagar?’ gave proofs of many of the formulae given
by Sw4miji. Recently, Bhanu Murthy”® has given proofs of some results. But as yet
no proofs of the 16 siitras exist. There is, therefore, the need for a comprehensive
work giving proofs of all the siitras wherein all the results in Vedic Mathematics
can be written.

SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS AND SUMS 551

The third and the most original aspect of Sankaracharya’s Vedic Mathematics
is its sitra style of formulation. These 16 siitras and 13 upa-siitras were constructed
and composed by the author himself in modern Sanskrit but employing the old
sitra-style**!2293!, While the cryptical quality of Vedic Mathematics comes from
the basic nature of sitra style of composition, the applicability of the very same
sitra to more than one area of mathematics depends on how the sitra is interpreted.
Consequently, the real problem of diversification of the area of applications of
Vedic Mathematics is how to bring the various branches of mathematics within the
orbit of the original siitra style, since this requires extraordinary power of intellection
and intuition quite apart from excellent scholarship in Mathematics and profundity
in Sanskrit language, particularly in grammar. It is worthwhile pointing out that the
more than one meaning that a siitra can have is not something that is unique to
Vedic Mathematics. In Sanskrit literature, it is not unusual for words and expressions
to bear more than one meaning each as good as the other. For instance, the word
Upanisad*? has four meanings, each as appropriate as the other. The compound word
Abhijfianasgakuntalam (ifTSrreTezaetA), the title of a play by Kalidasa can be
interpreted in four different ways, each of which is equally significant®®. Nevertheless,
Vedic Mathematics appears to have an empirical base when one notes that Bharati
Krsna seems to have suppressed the proofs of many mathematical formulae and then
abstracted them into the form of sitras. But, in this process, he has gained in two
respects : greater computational economy (by eliminating the intermediate
mathematical steps), and simplification of learning and the oral transfer of
information, As example, consider the problem 5 in the text:

5/(x-2) + 7/(x+4) = 12/(x-9)
It can be rewritten as
5/(x-2) + 7/(x+4) = 5/(x-9) + 7/(x-9)
By transposition, we get
5K{x-2) — S/(x-9) + 7x44) - T/(x-9) = 0
Or, (-7x5)(x-2)(x-9) + 7(-13V(x+4)(x~9) = 0
Cancelling out the common factor -7/(x—9) throughout, we get
S/(x-2) + 134(x+4) = 0
which is exactly the derived equation we got by the merger method.
As another example, consider algebraic equations of the type in eq. (5):

(QQ) + 1(Q.Q,) = 11Q.Q,) + 11Q,.Q,)

552 S. DAS

This can be rewritten as
UQQ) - 1Q.Q,) = 14Q,.Q,) + 14Q.Q,)
Or, (1/Q)(Q,-Q)MQ).Q,) = C/Q,(Q-Q,)(Q.Q,) (6)
Since Q, Q,, Q,, Q, are in Arithmetic Progression,
Q-Q=Q,-Q, and Q,- Q,= Q,- Q, 1)
Using the equalities of eq. (7), we can write
Q, - Q = (2Q, - Q,)-Q, = 2Q, - Q,) = 2(Q, - Q)
Substituting for (Q, - Q,) in eq. (6), we obtain
2(Q, — WKQ.Q,.Q) = (Q-Q,)MQ.Q,.Q) Or, 2/Q, = -1/Q,
Le., Q,(x) + 2Q,00)

0,
which is exactly the sutra formula L+2P = 0.

In addition to its mathematical aspects, Vedic Mathematics has a number of
educational values. The first of these is: it gives insight into the process of
mathematical computations, and makes one think and create. In this age of computers
and automata, when the classroom use of calculators is becoming widespread, the
need for thought, while working with numeral methods, is critically important for
teachers and students alike. One must not forget, that while teaching, one teaches
not only a specific numerical technique expressed in a specific programming language,
but also a method of thinking about and formulating tne solution of problems.
Second, Vedic Mathematics gives a greater sense of mathematical involvement, and
the students are better prepared intellectually, while at the same time providing an
efficient and accurate method of solving mathematical problems. There is yet another
way Vedic Mathematics can be made useful in the field of education. Let scholars
follow the current methods of calculation; but while checking the results, they can
follow the siitra methods. This would provide an independent and faster method of
verifying the results with a little or no change in the existing academic curriculae.
It is my feeling that teaching of materials like these in a course on numeral
computations will prove to be an extremely interesting and fruitful excercise. Besides,
teaching of a course on Vedic Mathematics will not require prior experience in the
subject.

Finally, success of Vedic Mathematics provides us with enough motivation to
examine, in depth, the siitra method as an alternative way (code language) of
expressing mathematical terminology because it is simple, more compact than and
as accurate as the symbolic method that is currently in use**.

SOLUTIONS OF SAMPLE PROBLEMS USING THE CURRENT METHODS

Problem 4
The equation is (x-coefficient rational number) :

2N(13x/3)-1] + 11(13x/3)+3] = 0
Or, {2{(13x/3)+3] + 1[(13x/3)-1]}/((13x/3)-1]f(1 3x/3)+3] = 0
Or, 2(13x+9) + (13x-3)/3 = 0
Or, 26x+18+13x-3 = 0
Or, 39x +15=0 Or, 13x+5=0 = x =-5/13
Problem 6
The equation is (x-coefficient irrational) :

2HN3x-1) + S/N2x+7) = (2V2+5V3)/(V6x+9)
Or, [2(V2x+7) + 5(V3x-D)VV3x-1)(V2x4+7) = (2V245V3)/(V6x+9)
Simplifying and cross-multiplying

[x(2V245V3) + 9} [V6x+9] = (2V2+5V3) (V6x?4+7V3x-V2x-7)
Or, x? (2V12+5V18) + 9V6x + 9x(2V2+5V3) + 81

= (2V12+5V18)x? + (14V6+105)x — (4+5V6)x - 14V2 - 353
Or, x(9V6+18V2+45V3) + 81 = x(9V6+101) — 14V2 ~ 35V3
Cancelling out the common term and rearranging,

x(18V2+45V3~101) = -(14V2 + 35V3 + 81)

Therefore, x = (14V2+35V3+81)/(101-18V2-45V3)
Problem 9

The simultaneous equations are (the x and y-coefficients are either integers or
rational numbers or irrational numbers) :

SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS AND SUMS
V19x + (5/2)y = 7 }

3x +V13y = 4/9}
Multiply eq. (1) by 3 and eq. (2) by N19, and subtract. We obtain,
(5/2)3y - V13 VI9y = 21-(4/9)V19
Or, y [(15 - 2V247)/2] = (189-4V19)/9
Therefore, y = (2/9)(189-4V19)(15-2V247)
Substituting this value of y in eq. (2), we get
3x + V¥13(2/9)(189-4V19)(15-2V247) = 4/9
Or, 3x = (4/9) — (2/9) (189V13-4V247)/(15-2V247)
= [4(15-2V247) -2(189V13-4¥247)1/9(1 5-2V247)
= (60-378V13)/9(15-2V247) = 6(10-63V13)/(15-2V247)9
Therefore, x = (2/9) (10-63V13)((15~2V247)
Problem 13
The simultaneous equations are (x-coefficients & constants integers)
499x + 172y = 212

1685428x = 82044 193113
1492315

- 1492315x=0 => x=0
Substituting this value of x in eq. (1), we get

499 x0+172y= 212 Or, 172y=212 = y = 212/172 = 53/43
Therefore, the solution is (0, 53/43).
Problem 14

The three equations in three variables are :

97x + ay + 43z = am qd)
49979x + by + (ptq)z = bm (2)
49(a-d)*x + cy + (m-n)?z = cm QB)

Set P = p+q, Q = (a-d)’, R = (m-n)>. Multiply eq. (1) by 49979 and eq. (2) by 97
and subtract eq. (2) from eq. (1).

We get (49979a-97b)y + (43x49979-97P)z = (49979a-97b)m (4)

Again, multiply eq. (2) by 49Q and eq. (3) by 49979 and subtract eq. (3) from eq.
(2). We get

(49bQ-49979c)y + (49PQ-49979R)z = (49bQ~49979c)m ()

SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS AND SUMS 559

Now multiply eq. (4) by (49bQ-49979c) and eq. (5) by (49979a-97b) and subtract.
We obtain

[(49bQ-49979c)(43x49979-97P) — (49979a-97b)(49PQ—49979R)]z

= [(49bQ-49979c)(49979a-97b) — (49979a-97b)(49bQ—49979c)]m = 0
Therefore, z = 0

Substituting for z in eq. (4), we get

(49979a-97b)y = (49979a-97b)m => y=m

Substituting for y and z in eq. (1), we obtain

97x +am=am => x=0

Therefore, the solution is (0, m, 0).

Problem 15

The simultaneous equations are (rational or irrational coefficients) :

(23/2)x - V4ly = 105} qd)

V41x  — (23/2)y = 99} (2)

Multiply eq. (1) by V41 and eq. (2) by 23/2 and subtract. We get,
y{(23/2)?-41} = 105V41-(2277/2)

Or, [(529-164)/4]y = (210V41-2277)/2

=> y = (420V41-4554)/365

Substituting for y in eq. (1), we obtain

(23/2)x — V41(420V41-4554)/365 = 105

Or, (23/2)x = 105+V41(420V41-4554)/365

(105x365+420x41-4554V41)/365

tt

Therefore, x = (38325+17220-4554V41)2/(23x365)

560 S. DAS
= 2(55545—-4554V41)/(23x365) = 2(2415-198V41)/365

= (4830-396V41)/365

Problem 16
The equation is (integral co-efficients) :

1/(3x2+5x+2) + 1/(5x?+8x+3) = 1/(7x?+11x+4) + 1/(15x2+19x+6)
Or, 1/(3x?+3x+2x+2) + 1/(5x?+5x+3x+3)

= 1/(7x?7+7x+4x+14) + 1/(15x?+10x+9x+6)
Or, 1/(3x(x+1)+2(x+1)] + 1/[5x(x4+1)+3(x+1)]

= W7x(x+1)+4(x+1)] + 1/[5x(3x+2)+3(3x+2)]
Or, 1/4(X+1)(3x+2) + 1/(5x+3)(x+1) = 1/(7x4+4)(x4+1) + 1/(5x+3)(3x+2)
Or, (5x+343x+2)/(x+1)(3x+2)(5x+3)

Or, (8x+5)(7x+4) = 22x?4+30x+10 Or, 56x?+32x+35x+20--22x?~30x-10 = 0
Or, 34x? + 37x + 10 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in x.
Therefore, x = [-37 + V(37?-4x34x10))/(2x34)

= [-37 + (1369-1360) /68 = (-3743)/68=-40/68 or -34/68

Therefore, x = -10/17 or -1/2
Problem 17
The equation is (x-coefficients integral or rational) :

[(x/2) VSPA (x/3)4V7P2 = (9x436V5)/(4x424V7)
Or, [(x+2V5)/4]19/(x+3V7)*] = (9x436V5)4x+24V7)
Cross-multiplication gives

9(x24+4V5x+20)(4x+24V7) = 4(x2+6V7+63)(9x+36V5)

SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS AND SUMS
Or, 9(4x3+24V7x2+16V5x24+96V35x+80x+480V7)

Or, 1548x = (4320V7-9072V5). Simplifying, we get

x = (120V7 - 252V5)/63
Problem 19

Sum to n terms the series

u, = [I(1+x) - 1/(1+2x)\/x
u, = [1/(1+2x) - 1/1+3x)/x
u, = [1A(143x) - 1/(1+4x)\/x

u, = [1/(1+nx) - 1/{1+(n+1)x}]/x
Therefore, by addition, we get the sum
S, = [l(1+x) - I/{ 1+ 1x} x

The n™ term (u,) is = [a™‘/(1+a""!x)(1+a""x)]
= (A/(1+a™!x) + B/(1+a""x) suppose;
Therefore, a! = A(1+a"") + B(i+a™'!x)
By putting 1+a™'x = 0,
We obtain, A = a™'/(1+a""x)
From eq. (1), x = —1/a""""'. Substituting for x in eq. (2),
A = a™'/[1-(a/a""""!)] = a""-/(1-a)

Similarly, by putting I+a""x equal to zero, we get

wo

= a®'/(14a™!x) = a-/[1+(a™)(-1/a"")]

= a™'/(1-ar!) = —a""/(1-a)

Therefore,
u, = (aV(1-a)(1+a""x)] ~ [a(1-a)(1+a""x)] and
u, = [1/(1+x) - a/(1+ax)/(1-a)

u, = [a/(1+ax) — a°/(1+ax)]/(1-a)

u, = [a""-Y(1+a""?x)] - [a/(1+a""x)/(1-a)

ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS IN INDIA

(Received 9 July, 1989)

Radha Gobinda Chandra was bom in the nineteenth century in a small village of
undivided Bengal in India. He did not even enter the portals of a college, but he would
make himself one of the pioneers in the study of variable stars in India. From old
records, it appears that contemporary astronomers of top class western organizations
used to attach great importance to the observations made by Radha Gobinda and great
recognition of his valuable works came from abroad. It is really unfortunate that he
remained almost unknown to his countrymen even after independence.

INTRODUCTION

In India, which is one of the oldest civilizations in the world, we get evidence of
astronomical observations as early as 4000 b.c. in the verses of the Rg-Veda' and in
some developed form later in the Yajur-Veda.” As early as 1300 B.c. the Hindus
developed a luni-solar calendar known as the Veddnga Jyotisa calendar. This was in
vogue upto the third century a.p. Thereafter, astronomy in our country took a sharp turn
and a new system based on scientific principles called the Siddhdntic system came into
prominence. This development which continued upto the 12th century a.p. came toa
standstill due to continued foreign invasions thereafter.

The prodmotion of the science of astronomy was not the aim of the British
Government in India. The optical telescope was discovered in the western world in the
year 1609 and its extensive use by Galileo revolutionized the study of astronomy. Very
few Indians at individual level were influenced by such revolution even in the
nineteenth century and it was almost a rare event for an academically less equipped
person. In this state of indigenous science of astronomy, it may be singular to find a
man born and brought up in a remote village of undivided Bengal during the British

104 A. BANDYOPADHYAY AND R. CHAKRABORTI

rule, far removed from all higher educational activity and the influence of imported
western civilization, silently threading his way into such a difficult science as
observational astronomy. It may be a unique experience to find a man sincerely striving
to acquire knowledge for its own sake, under difficulties less enormous than the
boldness of his attempt. Radha Gobinda Chandra is that man.

Not many of us, even those with an interest in astronomy, may be acquainted with
the name of Radha Gobinda Chandra, who is credited to the the first person not only in
India, but also in Asia to have observed a nova (a star which exhibits a sudden and
exceptional brightness, increasing rapidly to a maximum in several days) in the
constellation of Aquila on June 7, 1918. But he was well known to western astronomers
for his research work in astronomy. A petty clerk in the collectorate office, Radha
Gobinda was a keen observer of the stars and planets in the sky. After his day's toil in
office, he used to have a keen watch of the night sky at his house and kept meticulous
records of his observations. So accurate were his observations that they have been
widely acclaimed by established astronomers of Europe and America. The observations
made by Radha Gobinda covered mainly variable stars, nova, meteors, eclipse and so
on. His outstanding contribution in the field of variable stars helped in their
classification to a great extent.

Earvy Lire

Bengal, in the nineteenth century, presented a dark and dismal picture. On the one
side were the bigoted, superstitious Hindu orthodoxy upholding the cause of
obscurantism and blind faith, on the other side there was British rule and efforts to
anglicise the ‘heathen natives.? In the midst of this ocean of conservatism, Radha
Gobinda was born in July 1878 in a small village called Bagchar of Jessore district now
in Bangladesh. His father was Gorachand Chandra. He was brought up in the zaminder
family of his maternal uncle and, educated first in a local primary school and then at the
district High School. His academic career was brief and simple. He did not even
proceed as far as the Entrance examination.

Radha Gobinda Chandra (1878-1975)

ON RADHA GOBINDA CHANDRA 105

In his boyhood, Radha Gobinda once got the opportunity of going through a book
on astronomy in Bengali, viz. “Brahmdnda Ki Prakdnda”™ (how vast is the universe)
edited by Akshoy Kumar Dutta. That was a turning point in his life. Then on a clear
night, the dark sky glittered with the sparkling stars and the silvery haze of the Milky
Way attracted him. A number of questions started arising in his mind. What is a star?
What are they? How large is the universe? Where did the sun, moon and earth come
from? These were some of the questions which fascinated Radha Gobinda during his
early boyhood. At the age of fourteen, he felt extraordinary desire to test for himself the
position of the stars as they changed night after night. Also the varying position of the
planets among the stars led him to watch their movements. This idle curiosity exhibited
in star-gazing developed into a habit, of a really fruitful study of astronomy. There was,
however, no teacher who could instruct him in the science. But observational
astronomy certainly needs a guide. He, infact, took his first lesson on sky-watching
from Kalinath Mukherjee, a lawyer of Jessore and also a noted author of some books on
astronomy. Kalinath was then busy with editing a star atlas, Radha Gobinda assisted
him. By this way Radha Govinda gained a good knowledge of the atlas of the sky.
Kalinath in his school days at Krishnagar came in touch with Herschel, the then judge of
Krishnanagar court. Justice Herschel, an amateur astronomer, was a descendant of the
famous astronomers, William and James Herschel.°

Meanwhile, in 1899, at the age of 21, Radha Gobinda married a nine years old girl.
One year later he joined in Jessore Collectorate office as a podder (coin tester) with a
monthly salary of Rs. 15 only. He used to spend his day in the office, but coming back
home, his passion was sky-watching during the night. Unaided and surrounded, as he
was, by practical difficulties, what patient labour he must have undergone in his early
days to observe and work out practically the astronomical elements of the celestial
objects in the sky. What numberless observations must he have made to test the
significance of the changing brightness of selected stars. Night after night passed away
in the all-absorbing business of star-measurement. An eclipse of the sun or of the moon
was an event in his life never to be forgotten. Thus it was that this early days passed.

PIONEERING CONTRIBUTIONS TO ASTRONOMY

During its apparition in the year 1910, appearance of Halley’s Comet was one of
the most striking celestial phenomena to be seen by the naked eye and Radha Gobinda
took this opportunity to study it with the help of a binocular. He also at that time
contacted Prof. Jagadananda Roy of Visva Bharati for detailed information on Halley’s
comet and Prof. Roy in his reply gave him the full details of the physical ephemerides of
this comet and suggested Radha Gobinda to procure at least a small telescope for its
observation. He took obserations of this great comet night after night for about two
months and published a series of articles on this comet in a Bengali journal.® After this
astronomical event was over, he became impatient to have a telescope of his own for
observing celestial phenomena and out of savings from his very small income, Radha
Gobinda could finally purchase a 3-inch refracting telescope from London at a cost of
Rupees 160/-. This was in the year 1912. Such was his determination and utmost
fascination for astronomical observation.

106 A. BANDYOPADHYAY AND R. CHAKRABORTI

On the night of 7th June, 1918 Radha Gobinda could observe a nova from Jessore.
What is a nova? Nova is a latin word meaning a new star. But the term nova is
misleading since it is not a newly created star. Nova is a star that rises rapidly in
brightness from comparative obscurity but declines gradually. It is often designated by
the word Nova followed by the possessive of the constellation name and the year of the
outburst. The outburst occurs at place in the sky, where no star or only a very faint one,
was previously visible. A typical nova always pre-exists as a small unknown star of no
particular interest. Suddenly, its brightness increases by 10 to 15 magnitudes in the
course of several hours corresponding to an increase in brightness of 10* to 10° times..
The maximum is usually reached after two days at the most and lasts for a short time
only. The particular nova referred to above was Nova Aquilae 1918 and its magnitude
was measured by Harvard Observatory as 6.2 on June 7-8. Radha Gobinda observed it,
but he could not realise its importance; yet he reported it to the Director of Harvard
College Observatory in USA. Dr. Edward Pickering, the then Director, at once
recognised the merit of Chandra’s findings and made him a member of the American
Association of Variable Star Observers (AA VSO). Harvard Observatory also supplied
him necessary books, charts, etc. Since then Radha Govinda became an active member
of AAVSO, regularly contributing observations to the Association.

Most of his contributions to the foreign observatories were on variable stars. What
are variable stars? Wherein lies the importance in observing this celestial phenomenon?
Variable stars are those that varies in brightness with time, either regularly or
irregularly, with periods ranging from several hours to months. To decide whether a
Star is really variable or not requires observation over some years, particularly in the
case of with long-period variable. During this time, the brightness must be measured
continuously so as to arrive at the light curve. From the light curve the amplitude of the
variability and possibly the period can be determined and a first classification made.
The determination of magnitude (i.e., brightness) depends on the sensitivity of the
receivers used, viz., eye, photographic plate, photoelectric cell etc.). The total number
of stars now recognized as variables and for which the amplitudes, periods, times of
maximum and minimum magnitude etc. are known, is about 33,000, but new stars are
constantly being added to the list. Astronomers engaged in the research work on
variable stars require observational data on some particular stars continuously for
nights after nights. But this is not possible from one locations, as the observation may
not be feasible due to obscuration of the star by cloud covering at some observatory and
that is why astronomical observers on world-wide locations are selected for receiving
continuous observations of variable stars. Therein lay the importance of the
observational data on variable stars obtained by Radha Gobinda from Jessore in India.

With the help of his 3-inch refractor telescope, Radha Gobinda used to measure
accurately the variations in brightness of variable stars with utmost seriousness and his
astronomical findings in this respect were of much significance. And who were the
regular receipients of such observational findings from him? Most famous astronomical
organizations like Harvard Observatory of America, British Astronomical Association
and Lyon Observatory of France, used to receive regularly such observations on

ON RADHA GOBINDA CHANDRA 107

variable stars from Radha Gobinda. A huge number of observations made by him can
still be found in the archives of Harvard, British Astronomical and Lyon Observatories.
Some references to Chandra in the Annual Reports of the American Association of
Variable Star Observers can be seen (Annexure-1). Famous astronomical journals like
“Sky and Telescope”’ also mentioned his name in relation to the reports regarding
variable stars.

Apart from AAVSO, the British Astronomical Association, American Meteor
Society, American Museum of Natural History and Lyon Observatory, France offered
him their memberships.

There are two references that are available from British Astronomical Association
which are shown here (Annex. Il), and also a few records of Chandra from Lyon
Observatory can be seen (Annex. III).

In June, 1946, the AAVSO published a Roll of Honour of its members who had
completed 10,000 or more observations on variable stars, comets etc. This roll
contained names of 25 such members all over the world and one amongst them was
Chandra. In 1947, he became an emeritus member of AAVSO. Chandra contributed
37000 variable star observations to the AAVSO from [920 to 1954.

Another of his contributions was in regard to Paricdhg (conventional almanac)
rectification. There are distinctly two classes of Paficdng published in our country. In
one type of Paricdng, the calculated positions of the sun, the moon and planets, as
published, agree with their actual positions in the heavens. This system is known as
Drksiddha Pancang which is correct and accurate. In the other system, the calculated
positions of the heavenly bodies, as published, do not agree with the acutal positions in
the sky. This class is known as old and incorrect Paricdng. Majority of Parcdngs
published in our country belong to the latter group, i.e. astronomical elements, as
published, are completely erroneous. A movement was started in Bengal by late Prof.
MN Saha, and late NC Lahiri to wipe out such erroneous publications of astronomical
elements in Paficdhg. Radha Gobinda was associated with this movement and wrote a
good number of articles for this purpose, which were published in reputed journals in
Bengali. He delivered several lectures in support of this movement and also to
popularise the reformed Drksiddha Pancang.

RECOGNITION FROM ABROAD

From whatever is available of his old records, it appears that contemporary
western astronomers attached great importance to the observations made by Radha
Gobinda Chandra. One letter addressed to him by Harvard College Observatory on
January 17, 1920 states: “The observations which you contributed are very good and we
hope you will continue to send them every month.” Similarly, a jetter from the British
Astronomical Association, dated December 27, 1923 says, “Your excellent
observations and remarks are always much valued by this section (variable star section)

108 A. BANDYOPADHYAY AND R. CHAKRABORTI

and I hope we may continue to enjoy your hearty enthusiastic support”. Dr. Harlow
Shapley, the then Director of the Harvard College Observatory and an astronomer of
international repute, appreciated contributions of Radha Gobinda very much and this
may be verified from his letter written to Chandra.

Recently, in reply to a letter dated July 31, 1984 from one of the authors
(Chakraborty), the Director of the American Association of Variable Star Observers
wrote, “Mr. Chandra submitted thousands of variable star observations. His report
forms fill two huge folders in our permanent titles. His observations are in the
permanent records also of each star he observed. He was a very valued member of the
AAVSO”.

To help Radha Gobinda in his meticulous study on observational astronomy,
Harvard Observatory presented him with a 6-inch telescope in 1926 which was sent to
his native village directly from U.S.A. In the later years of his life, when he could no
longer take observations, he handed over this telescope to late Dr. M.K. Vainu Bappu,
who in later years became the first Director of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics,
Bangalore. It has been kept in the Kavalur Observatory as a tribute to Radha Gobinda’s
dedicated work.

The Ministry of the French Government honoured Radha Gobinda by conferring
on him the title “Officer d’ Academic. The title and a medal were forwarded to him by
the Consulate General of the Government of France in Calcutta on August 1, 1928.

The concerned letter is quoted below:

Consulate General de La Republique France,
Calcutta.

Dear Sir,

In continuation of my letter dated 26.3.28, I have the honour to inform you that the
Ministry of Education has decided to confer upon you the distinction of Officer
d’ Academic.

You will find herein enclosed the Brevet and the Badge of this distinction for
which I shall be obliged to receive a receipt.

Tam pleased to convey to you my best congratulations for the token that has been
granted to you in recognition of your valuable services to the Observatory of Lyon.

Yours faithfully,
Mr. R.G. Chandra R. Lazonies
Bagchar, Jessore. Consul General for France

ON RADHA GOBINDA CHANDRA 109
Last PHASE

After independence, Radha Gobinda with his family migrated to India from
erstwhile East Pakistan. Before his final settlement at Barasat, he was at Panihati, near
Calcutta, where the continued to pursue his astronomical activities. He founded an
astronomical club and wrote several books on popular astronomy in Bengali out of
which only one ‘Dhumketu’® (comet) was published during his life time (second edition
of this book was published in 1985) and the rest are still in manuscript form. In course of
his transit from Jessore to Barasat, a major part of his collections were lost.

At the good old age of 97, Radha Gobinda expired on 3 April, 1975. It is really
unfortunate that the man who won recognition for his valuable works on astronomy
from top class astronomical organizations of the western world, was not honoured in
any form by his own countrymen even after independence. It is also unfortunate that no
serious attempt has so far been made to explore the complete works of this dedicated
astronomer who won international acclaim through sheer perseverance and hard work.

CONCLUSION

Radha Gobinda has no one to encourage him in his pursuit and no notice was taken
of his work in our country. Yet from his life and works, it can be easily seen, how a man
wihout any university degree, any training in the specialised field of work, or an
well-equipped astronomical observatory, can make himself one of the pioneers in the
study of variable stars in India, only with utmost devotion for work and perseverance.
Let us hope that the past neglect of his countrymen may yet be compensated and that his
scientific endeavour will give him proper place in the history of Indian science.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

[OCT. 1935] COMMUNICATION TO THE ASSOCIATION. 407

Ranu:— There have been several communications to the Association” regarding
“Rahu,” but so far there has been no correct explanation. Hindoo astronomy may be
divided into two sections, mythological and mathematical. In the Indian Epics there are
many narratives and fables relating to celestial bodies, and these may be taken to
constitute the first of these sections. As well as Rahu there is another term Ketu, and

112 A. BANDYOPADHYAY AND R. CHAKRABORTI

there are with these, planets called “Nabagraham,” viz., Rabi, the Sun; Shome, the
Moon; Kuja, Mars; Budha, Mercury; Guru, Jupiter; Shitau, Venus; Manda, Saturn,
Rahu being the ascending node and Ketu the descending node. These are regarded as
powerful deities having influence on the affairs of humanity, and they are also used in
Indian astrology.

In the Sreemat Bhagabat Puran, Part 8, Chapter 9, Shloks 21-23, it is narrated that
Rahu was a Danab (demon), the son of Shinghika, the wife of Biprachitti. The Danabs
were the antiparty of the Devs, having no right to drink the “Amrita,” a divine liquor
which made the Devs immortal. Rahu made an attempt in disguise to drink the Amrita
along with the Devs, but this was pointed out by Surja (the Sun) and Chandra (the
Moon). On this, Hari, the Prince of the Devs, cut off the head of Danab Rahu, but as a
smal! quantity of the Amrita entered the throat his head become immortal and was
placed in the sky as a “Graha.” The Sun and Moon having betrayed his attempt to drink
the Amrita, Rahu developed a hatred for them, which has resulted in his endeavouring
to devour them whenever he gets an opportunity; this he cannot do because he has only a
head and no body.

This is the story from the epic, of Rahu and the cause of eclipses; but Indian
astronomers have known the real causes from time immemorial.

As Rahu’s body was not immortal it was thrown away, but at a later date Indian
astronomers and astrologers placed the body as Ketu, 180° from Rahu in the Zodiac.

In Hindoo mathematical astronomy Rahu and Ketu, the ascending and descending
node, of the planet’s orbits, resemble the Greek Dragon’s Head and Tail, and are the
two points where eclipses occur, being referred to as Patha in the Surja Shiddanta —

A versatile genius Asutosh Mukhopadhyay
(1864 – 1924) has been one of our highly respected
and admired national heroes for his achievements
in different fields and for his various good
qualities. He was a visionary person of towering
personality. He not only showed keen interest and
intense love for mathematics in his student life,
he was a mathematical prodigy. He began his life
as a research student of mathematics when
research in the subject was particularly unknown
in India and he wanted to be a research professor.
But circumstances compelled him to leave
mathematical research. He drifted into law and
became a famous lawyer and eminent judge.
Simultaneously, he served as Vice-Chancellor of
Calcutta University. In spite of his professional
responsibility and many other obligations his
association with mathematical activity and love
for mathematics remained for whole life. Besides,
his contribution to mathematics and his endeavour
for fostering mathematical research should be
remembered with honour and respect. Under this
back drop the author has made an attempt to
highlight his mathematical talent, his contribution
to mathematics and his effort for propagating study
and research in mathematics. At the same time,
the author has made an effort to describe his role
as jurist and judge, as great educationist and
builder of Calcutta University, and as great patriot
and achiever of noble deeds.
 The author, who is an expert in history and
pedagogy of mathematics, is still engrossed in
research and popularizing mathematics in various
ways. This book is one of the ten published books
written by him and it is an outcome of his effort in
popularizing mathematics and mathematicians. In
this book he has tried to unfold mainly Sir
Asutosh’s mathematical talent and has described
his other qualities also, especially for the young
learners.
The book is divided into a few main parts like
‘The Career of a Versatile Genius’, ‘Contribution
to Mathematics’, ‘Different Aspects of Asutosh’s
life through Quotations’, ‘Appendices’. Again
each part is further divided into a few chapters to
have ideas of different phases of Asutosh’s life,
his contribution and other things regarding him.
 The part entitled ‘The Career of a Versatile
Genius’ consists of eight chapters, namely,
Parentage and education; Study and Involvement
of law; Mathematics, Asutosh and IACS; Asutosh
and Calcutta University; Involvement with
different spheres; Multifaceted attributes of

DOI: 10.16943/ijhs/2019/v54i1/49603BOOK REVIEW: ASUTOSH MUKHOPADHYAY: MATHEMATICAL GENIUS WITH THE MAGIC WAND 111
Asutosh; Quotable Quotes; Excerpts from
Convocation address. Each chapter, though
concisely written, provides, as far as practicable,
all the information to have thorough ideas about
the heading of the chapter. The author has
authenticated information by giving various
quotations from different sources off and on. At
the end of each of the chapters the author
introduces ‘Notes’ in which a reader can
understand implicitly the source of reference and
explanation of terms and personalities described
in the chapter. In the next chapter on Involvement
with different spheres, readers learn about
Asutosh’s involvement with various organizations,
his multifarious activities and his great bibliophile
nature. In Multifaceted attributes of Asutosh, the
author has used Asutosh’s diary and other
materials to portray his different qualities,
character and traits for which he is so highly
revered and famous. The chapter on Quotable
Quotes contains various comments of celebrated
personalities regarding his versatility, personality
and greatness collected from different sources.
From Excerpts from Convocation address we
understand Asutosh’s philosophy of life,
perception to values, inspiration and advice to the
youth, his love for nation and education.
 The part ‘Contribution to Mathematics’ needs
special attention of readers. This part has been
divided into the following chapters: Research and
Research Papers, Problems from Pott’s Euclid,
Mainardi’s Problem and Asutosh, A Survey of
Asutosh’s work, Concern with study and research
in Mathematics. In the chapter on ‘Research and
Research Papers’, the author has given the list of
research papers of Asutosh taking information
mainly from two important sources, namely
Calcutta Review, July, 1924 and Bulletin of
Calcutta Mathematical Society, vol. XV(4) (1924–
25). It is interesting to note that though Asutosh’s
first research paper was published in vol.10 of
Messenger of Mathematics, Cambridge in 1880–
1881 session, it was ‘discovered nearly five years
ago’ by Asutosh, that is when he was about 12
years old. We also find in this chapter the list of
memberships and fellowships Asutosh received
on account of his research. Asutosh solved 348
problems of Pott’s Euclid in his school days. We
have a glimpse of a few of them in the chapter
‘Problems from Pott’s Euclid’. In the next chapter
‘Mainardi’s Problem and Asutosh’, we find the
history, statement of the problem of Mainardi and
his solution. This led Asutosh to write two research
papers. In the first one Asutosh not only gave the
elegant solution of the problem, but gave the
beautiful geometric interpretation of the result
obtained. And in the second one Asutosh
formulated a general theorem. We find a detailed
discussion of these in this chapter. The following
chapter is an important one. Here at the first phase
the author discusses in detail the proof of Asutosh’s
first published paper illuminating many interested
readers. Then he gives ideas, in a nutshell, about
each of the remaining research papers. In the
second phase, we find brief discussion about the
books entitled ‘An Elementary Treatise on the
Geometry of Conics’ and ‘Arithmetic for Schools’,
the two very good text books written by Asutosh.
In the third phase we learn that 235 problems and
solutions (80 problems and 155 solutions) sent by
Asutosh were published in the Educational Times,
London. A few problems proposed by Asutosh and
a few solutions given by him have been narrated
here to have some ideas about mathematical
acumen and genius of Sir Asutosh. In the chapter
on ‘Concern with study and research in
Mathematics’, we come to know about the
background and objectives of founding of Calcutta
Mathematical Society in 1908 and starting of the
research journal (Bulletin of Calcutta Mathem-
atical Society) in 1909 and involvement of a
galaxy of mathematicians and scientists like C E
Cullis, W H Young, Shyamadas Mukhopadhyay,
Gurudas Banerjee, B N Seal, C V Raman, Ganesh
Prasad, S N Bose, M N Saha, N R Sen, S K Mitra,
and others. In this chapter the author also112
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
reproduces a few portions of entry of Asutosh’s
diary to tell us about his passion and love for
mathematics, as well as his concern, involvement
and activity with mathematics.
 The part ‘Different Aspects of Asutosh’s Life
through Quotations’ contains precisely 68
‘Quotations’ (8 + 13 + 7+ 26+ 8 +6) to put more
light on Asutosh’s ‘Boyhood, Education, Career’,
‘Mathematical Talent and Versatility’, ‘Involve-
ment with Law’, ‘Involvement with University’,
‘Propagation of Study and Research’, ‘Love for
Books and Language’, none of these quotations
being repeated earlier.
 In ‘Appendices’, we find detailed chronology
of important events of Asutosh’s life for quick
reference, list of different honours received by
him, list of books written by him in English,
Sanskrit and Bengali, and information about his
addresses, lectures, etc. The author also reproduces
from Asutosh’s Dairy the ‘List of Professors of
Presidency College’ when Asutosh was student of
the college. ‘Books mentioned in Asutosh’s Dairy’
have also been given so that one can understand
how much importance he gave to collect and read
various books on mathematics and science.
 We also find many photos and documents
concerning Sir Asutosh scattered here and there
in the book along with a genealogical table. In the
end, under the heading ‘References’, we find a
rich list of books and papers from where the author
has collected material to write the book which will
benefit the readers.
 Overall, the author has toiled hard and long to
produce such an informative and important book
on Sir Asutosh narrating many facts and anecdotes
of his life and collecting significant information
about mathematics of Asutosh. I think, the book
will be of great interest to many people,
particularly to young generation and persons

 Now, a few suggestions for next edition of the

there is a typographical mistake in describing the
point. This may be removed. It should be
X = h cosϕ cosh (λ + ϕ); Y = h sinϕ sinh (λ + ϕ).
(ii) A little more mention with more theorems,
illustrations and examples may be given from the

Al-Birfini’s quest for knowledge for Indian Science is commendable. In
his own country he studied the subject from translations of Sanskrit
texts and other allied Arabic works. But when he came to India in the
eleventh century he went through some of the terse Sanskrit texts with
the help of Indian scholars, Even complicated orthographical and
grammatical forms of a foreign language rendered more difficult by
mistakes of careless copyists left him undaunted in his pursuit. His India
is a valuable contribution to the study of the history of Indian Science,
especially astronomy and mathematics. The most important astronomical
works that al-Biriini studied are the Brdéhmasphutasiddhanta (BSS) and
the Khandakhadyaka (KK) of Brahmagupta, the outstanding astronomer
of the seventh century, whose works even in al-Biriini’s time dominated
the western and north-western parts of India. Al-Birini quotes profusely,
from both these works in India and the object of the present paper is
to trace these quotations in the available editions of the two texts. The
paper will show that most of these references can be located though a
few ascribed to Brahmagupta are actually the statements of his
commentators,

Al-Birtinit came to India in the eleventh century. It appears that even
then he had a general knowledge of Indian astronomy acquired probably by
studying Arabic translations of some Sanskrit texts and other related works
by Arab scholars. While in the country he studied the subject from the
original Sanskrit treatises with the help of Indian Pandits, as he himself
acknowledges. The most important texts are the Bréhmasphutasiddhanta (BSS)
and the Khandakhadyaka (KK) of Brahmagupta of the seventh century, both
of which had already been translated into Arabic. Al-Biriint even began
translating BSS, but it is not known whether he completed the work. He
quotes from both these works in his India. This paper deals with these
quotations.!

First the quotations from BBS, in which are given in detail the astronomical
theories of Brahmagupta. There are two editions of BSS—Dvivedi’s and
Sharma’s. Neither can be called strictly critical. The editions have not been pre-
pared after collation of important manuscripts both of the text and commentaries
available and detailed examination of other allied materials, though Sharma’s
edition gives a few variants from four or five different manuscripts. The text
in both the editions is practically the same. All the references in this paper
are to Sharma’s text.

Both the editions of BSS have twenty-four chapters each, arranged in
the same manner. Al-Birtini’s BSS also has twenty-four chapters though in a
different order (1, pp. 153-155). Goladhydya, the chapter on spherics, is the
twenty-first chapter in the printed editions; it is the first chapter according to
VOL. 10, No. 2

162 BINA CHATTERJEE

al-Biriini. In al-Biriini’s BSS the twenty-first chapter is on ‘calculation of the
measures of poetry and metrics’ and the twenty-fourth on ‘numerical notation
in the metrical books’; in the printed editions there is only one chapter on
‘metrics’ called ‘ChandaSeityuttaradhyaya’ and it is the twentieth chapter.
Samjfiadhyaya, the twenty-fourth chapter in the printed editions, is not
mentioned by al-Biriini, yet he quotes from this chapter when he says that
according to Brahmagupta, Siirya, Indu, Pulisa, Romaka, Vasistha, Yavana
and other Siddhantas (Astronomical treatises) are substantially the same, though
giving different times and places while calculating mean positions of planets
(xxiv. 3).

It may be observed here that the arrangement in the printed editions
tallies with the number of the chapter given in the verse at the end of each
chapter. [It is also note-worthy that Prthudaka while writing commentary on
BSS first wrote on Goladhydya and then on the remaining chapters This is
evident from his own statement at the end of the commentary (Sharma’s ed.,
IV, P. 1651).

There is another chapter, Dhyanagrapopadesadhydya, the twenty-fifth.
appended to BSS. It is not clear what makes al-Birtni say that in this chapter
Brahmagupta ‘tries to solve the problems by speculation, not by mathematical
calculation’. This chapter gives formulas for calculating positions of planets.
etc. briefly, and thev can all be mathematically established as has already been
shown by Dvivedi in his edition. About this chapter Brahmagupta himself says,
‘Ganitena phale siddhirbrahme dhyana-grahe’ (xxiv. 9), that is, the results are
mathematically calculated’. Brahmagupta’s famous formula, interpolation by
using the second difference, is given in this chapter.

Al-Biriini then quotes (1, pp. 368-370, 386) what Brahmagupta means by
kalpa. This is a day of Brahma, the Creator, at the beginning of which planets,
etc. come into existence and perish at the end of it (i. 28).

1 kalpa is 14 manus together with their beginning and end, and therefore.
4 mahayugas x 15

10

The kalpa commences when all the planets, etc. are between Revati
({Piscium) and Asvint (Arietis) at the beginning of the month Caitra and
at sunrise at Lanka (i. 3-4).

Brahmagupta adds that some astronomers take 994 maha@yugas in a kalpa
while Arvabhata (fifth century) takes it to be 1008 (i. 11-12).

Al-Birint says (1, pp. 372-374) that according to Brahmagupta one
mahdayuga consists of 4,320,000 solar years and is divided into 4 yugas—Krta
(1, 728,000), Treta (1,296,000), Dvapara (864,000), and Kali (432,000) (i. 7-8).
A\-Biraint comments that Brahmagupta criticizes Aryabhata for assuming all
the four yugas of equal lengths and thereby going against the religious tradition
of the Hindus (i. 9; xi. 10).

The revolutions of the sun, moon and planets and those of their apses
and nodes in a kalpa as given by al-Biriint (11, pp. 16, 186) occur in BSS,
i, 15-21. The solar, lunar and intercalary months and the civil days in a kalpa
are given in i. 22-24.

is equal to 14x71 mahdyugas plus or 1000 mahayugas (i. 10).

AL-BIRUNI AND BRAHMAGUPTA. 163

AlL-Biriini never saw (1, p. 370) any work of Aryabhata but on the authority
of Brahmagupta gives 1,577,917,500 as the number of civil days in a mahayuga
as calculated by Aryabhata. What Brahmagupta actually says in the Tantra-
pariksddhyaya (called by al-Biriini as critical Research on the Basis of the
Canons) is this—Ayyabhata knew that there were 4,320,000 solar years in a
maha@yuga both according to the midnight (Ardharatrika) and sun-rise
(Audayika) systems, then how did he calculate 1,577,917,500 according to the
latter (xi. 5).

Al-Biriini correctly reproduces (II, pp. 28-30, 57-60) the method given by
Brahmagupta for calculating the Ahargana or civil days (i. 30-31) and the
positions of the planets from the beginning of a Aalpa (i.32). In the latter
case to avoid calculation with large numbers, additive quantities till the
beginning of Kaliyuga are given. These are identical with the data in 1. 52-57.

Al-Biriini gives (I, pp. 243, 267-268, 272, 279-280) a long description of
the Mount Meru, the dwelling of the gods and the demons, their day and
night and of the shape of the universe and the earth according to the Hindu
religious beliefs and quotes Brahmagupta in support. In fact only a few of
these statements are given by Brahmagupta in the verses 1-8 of Golddhyaya in
BSS and other occur in the commentary by Prthiidaka on these verses—this
commentary unedited is appended to Sharma's edition. For instance, Brahma-
gupta in verse 3 says that the Mount Meru stands high on the surface of the
earth but the commentary says that the stars revolve round it and the sun,
moon, etc. are visible because of it. Brahmagupta describes the universe as a
sphere with the round earth at its centre and it is Prthidaka who says that
as it is the nature of the fire to burn, that of the water to flow, and that
of the wind to set things in motion, so it is the nature of the earth to stand
and hold the things; and so on.

Al-Biriini maintains (I, p. 158) that he never saw any work by Prthtdaka
yet some of his statements ascribed to Brahmagupta really occur in Prthiidaka’s
commentary, which is in prose.

Brahmagupta refutes the Jaina belief that there are two suns, two moons
and fifty-four stars (xi.3). Al-Biriini quotes (II, p. 82) this but erroneously
says that this occurs in the book of the Veda.

-.. Al-Biriint knows (I, p. 276) that Brahmagupta does not agree with
Aryabhata about the motion of the earth (xi. 17).

The measure of circumference of a circle according to Brahmagupta is
V/10.d%, where d is the diameter (xii. ii, 40). This has been recorded by
al-Biriini. (I. p. 168).

ALBiriini calculates (Il, p. 71) the measures of the circumferences in
yojanas (yojana=8 miles according to al-Biriini) of the orbits of the sun, moon,
planets and the stars following Brahmagupta’s formula. The measurement of
the heaven which is 18, 712, 069, 200, 000, 000 yojanas, when divided by the
number of revolutions of each planet in a kalpa, gives its circumference in
yojanas. Al-Biriint’s results are more or less the same as those given by Prthi-
daka in his commentary on the verses 11-12 of Goladhyaya (Sharma’s ed., IV,
p. 1623; text is incorrect).

164 BINA CHATTERJEE

Al-Biriini also calculates the radii of these orbits, using w= 4/10 approxi-
mately as given by Brahmagupta. Prthtidaka also has given these distances in
his commentary on Golddhydya 31 but comparison is impossible as the text is
hopelessly incorrect (Sharma's ed., IV, p. 1636).

Brahmagupta gives earth’s circumterence as 5000 yojanas (i. 37). The
diameters of the earth, sun and moon are respectively 1581, 6522 and 480
yojanas as given in Golddhydya 32. Al-Biriini’s figures are the same (II, p. 77).

AlL-Birini quotes (II, pp. 75-77) Brahmagupta as prescribing two methods
for calculating earth’s shadow. These are given in BSS, xxiii 8-10.

In India there are passages (II, pp. 110-112) from BSS (xxi. 37-48) in
which Brahmagupta appears to support the views expressed in the religious
works of the Hindus that the eclipse, solar and lunar, is caused by Rahu, a
demon and chides Aryabhata, Varaha, Srisena, Visnucandra and others for
expressing otherwise. Al-Biriini correctly observes that Brahmagupta is trying
to adjust science with popular beliefs but is ready to overlook it recalling the
fate of Socrates.

Al-Biriint notes (I, p. 376) that Brahmagupta frequently and severely
criticizes Aryabhata; for instance, he blames Aryabhata for making the apsis
of the moon faster (al-Birtini says slower, which is not correct) and the moon’s
node slower and thereby confusing the calculation of eclipse. Aryabhata is
compared to a worm in the wood, which while eating the wood draws figures
without realising it. Just as a deer would not face a lion, so Aryabhata and
others, ignorant as they are, would not face the scholar, who understood
astronomical theories correctly (i. 62-63). Al-Biriini realises the injustice of
this harshness.

There are two more quotations from Brahmagupta in India which are
not traceable at the present moment. One relates to the use of arithmetic in
metrics (I, pp. 147-150). As mentioned above there is a chapter on metres
in BSS, but it is extremely difficult to decipher it without the help of a
commentary.

The second reference is to the use of words signifying numerals, e.g. moon
denotes 1; sun 12; etc. (I, p. 177).

So much about the quotations from BSS.

Now the Khandakhddyaka. It is, so to say, an astronomical handbook
containing important formulas briefly set down and useful for everyday
calculations. These start from midnight at Lanka. Brahmagupta wrote
it thirty-seven years after his first work, BSS, that is, in av. 665.

At present three editions of KK are available—two incomplete and one
complete,’ containing Pirva (first part) and Uttara (second part). Al-Birini
was familar with both these parts and quotes from both. He knows (I, p. 156)
that in the first part Brahmagupta uses the astronomical constants of Aryabhata’s
Ardharatrika (midnight) system but in the second book he gives improved
methods (KP, i; KU, i.l).

Al -Biriini quotes (II, pp. 46-47) the rules for calculating Ahargana or
civil days between two dates from KP (i. 3-5). He also describes (II, p. 60) a
general method for computation of mean places of planets (KP, ii, 1-5).

AL-BIRUNI AND BRAHMAGUPTA 165

There are two rules supposed to be from the canon Khandakhadyaka to
find lords of a year and of a month, (JI, pp. 119-120). These rules are not
given in KK but occur in Bhattotpala’s commentary on this treatise at the end
of the first chapter (text p. 39; first rule slightly altered). Both the rules are
claimed to be his own.

(In the manuscript used by me for my edition of Bhattotpala’s commentary,
the rule pertaining to the calculation of the lord of a month is not introduced
by the commentator with the words, ‘asmadiyaryeyam’ or ‘this verse is mine’.
These are, however, given in the manuscript in the Scindia Oriental Institute,
Ujjain, which I have now read).

Al-Birtint makes a reference to KP,i. 15, when he quotes (I, p. 312) 4800
yojanas ad the circumference of the earth and also gives the method of

. . . R sine colatitude
correction, namely, corrected circumference =circumference x —— _—___

radius
as in KU, i. 6.

He is probably referring to KP, iv. 2, when he says (II, p. 79) that the
methods to calculate the diameters of the sun, moon and the earth’s shadow,
as given in KK are the same as those given by al-khwarizmi.

Al-Biriini tabulates (II, pp. 83-85) the twenty-seven naksatras (lunar
mansions), the number of stars in each, the ‘polar’ longitude and latitude of
each junction star. The table on the whole agrees with the figures given in
KP, ix. 1-10. The extension of each naksatra (II, p. 87) is the same as in
KU, i. 7-11. The distance of each naksatra from the sun, necessary for its
heliacal rising is 14 (IJ, p. 90), the same as in KU, v. 7.

Al-Biriini’s data (II, p. 91) relating to the ‘polar’ longitude, latitude, and
the distance in degrees necessary for heliacal visibility of Af{rgavyddha occur in
KU, v. 6; the longitude and the distance for Agastya are also the same as in
KU, v. 5 but al-Biriini’s latitude is 71° and not 77°.

Al-Biriini describes (II, pp. 91-92) the method for calculating the times
for heliacal rising and setting of a naksatra. This is a reference to KU, v. 8-12

Al-Biriini records (II, p. 116) two rules for calculating the possibility of
an eclipse—solar or lunar. One is given in Bhattotpala’s commentary and is
claimed to be his own (text p. 104). The other cannot be traced.

The above references show that al-Birant was acquainted with BSS and
some parts of Prthudaka’s commentary though he may not have known it as
such. And he was also familiar with KK, both KP and KU. Was al-Biriini’s KK
an expanded version in which Brahmagupta’s text was interspersed with
Bhattotpala’s explanatory verses composed in the same metre??

MEAN SUN AND MOON IN ANCIENT GREEK AND INDIAN ASTRONOMY
GEORGE ABRAHAM

Plot 1520, 12th Main Road, Anna Nagar
Madras-600040

(Received 6 May 1991)

Astudy is made of the values of the length of the year and month used in the theories
of Ptolemy, Aryabhata and Brahmagupta. In comparing these values, we must take into
account the fact that Prolemy used tropical coordinates and the Indian astronomers used
sidereal coordinates. The correct values are based on accurate modern formulae.

INTRODUCTION

The length of the year and the month are fundamental parameters in astronomical
theories. In this paper, 1 consider specifically the values of these parameters which
occur in the theories of the Greek astronomer Ptolemy and the Indian astronomers
Aryabhata and Brahmagupta. To assess their accuracy, we must compare them with the
corresponding values obtained by using modern formulae in a recent ephemeris’.

THE MODERN VALUES

The values calculated from the modern formulae are given in Table | for the period
0 AD to 600 AD. For the sun’s motion, we need the values of the tropical and sidereal
year, and for the moon, the tropical, sidereal, synodic, anomalistic and draconitic
months. Ptolemy’s observations recorded in the Almagest range from AD 127 to 141?
(p.1). The dates of the Aryabhatiya and Brahmasphutasiddhanta are AD 499 and
628° (pp 92, 96).

ProLeMy

The source for Ptolemy's parameters is the Almagest, of which there is a recent
translation by G.J. Toomer’.

It is important to emphasize that Ptolemy had a strong preference for tropical,
rather than sidereal, coordinates. This is clearly stated in the following two extracts (p.

132):

“The only points which we can consider proper starting-points for the sun’s
revolution are those defined by the equinoxes and solstices........

384 GEORGE ABRAHAM

ceeeeeee it seems unnatural to define the sun’s revolution by its return to (one of) the

Ptolemy’s observations confirmed Hipparchus’ measure of the tropical year. He
quotes Hipparchus as having written * (p.139):

“I have also composed a work on the length of the year in one book, in which }
show that the solar year (by which I mean the time in which the sun goes from a solstice
back to the same solstice, or from an equinox back to the same equinox) contains 365
days, plus a fraction which is less than % by about 1/300th of the sum of one day and

”

night,..... .
Thus, the Hipparchus - Ptolemy tropical year is:

() Y,=365 + 14 — 1/300 = 365.246666... = 365; 14,48 days.

Since the date of Ptolemy’s observations is around AD 150, the modern value for that

date found from Table Lis Y,° = 365.242417 days. The difference | Y, — Y,°! divided by
Y,° is 1.16 x 1075. These results are given in Table II.

After completing the theory of the sun in Chapter III of the Almagest, Ptolemy
takes up the motion of the moon in Chapter [V. For the parameters of the lunar mean
motion, Ptolemy follows Hipparchus who in turn used Babylonian period relations. He
accepts Hipparchus value of the synodic month ? (p.176):

(2) My = 29; 31,50,8,20 = 29,.53059413 days.

This is a Babylonian parameter, and is remarkably close to the modern value for
AD 150 (Table 1), My= 29.53059398. From M, and the tropical year Y,, the tropical
month can be derived.

Instead, Ptolemy calculates the daily motion in longitude? (p.179):

(3) 13;10,34,58,33,30,30 = 13.176382215 degrees per day.

MEAN SUN AND MOON IN ANCIENT GREEK AND INDIAN ASTRONOMY 385

Dividing 360° by (3), we get the tropical month M, and the corresponding modern
value Mf is obtained from Table |:

(4) M, = 27.32161181 days, Mf = 27.32158789 days.

For the anomalistic and draconitic motion, Ptolemy makes small corrections to
Hipparchus’ values. His mean daily anomalistic and draconitic motions are 2 (p.179):

13; 3,53,56,17,51,59° = 13.06498286°
13; 13,45,39,48,56,37° = 13.229350999°

The corresponding months, their modern values and the relative errors are given in
Table III.

ARYABHATA AND BRAHMAGUPTA
Aryabhata and Brahmagupta used sidereal co-ordinates. Their year length and

months follow from the data inTable II which gives the number of revolutions in one
yuga, of the earth, sun, moon, moon’s apogee and node.

Aryabhata had two systems, the sunrise system (S), given in the Aryabhatiya* and
the Midnight system (M), given in the Khandakhddyaka®. These differ only in R,, the
number of earth’s revolutions. The source for Brahmagupta’s number (divided in Table
2 by 1000) is the Brahmasphutasiddhanta’.

The lengths of the year and the months follow from the following formulae:

CoMMENTS

From Table III, we see that Ptolemy’s errors for the tropical year and month are
larger than the errors of the Indian astronomers for the sidereal year and month.
However, his values for the synodic, anomalistic and draconitic months (for which the

credit must go to Babylonian astronomers) are much better than those of Aryabhata and
Brahmagupta.

- P.C.Sengupta’ (p.x lvi) has compared Ptolemy’s parameters with those of
Aryabhata and Brahmagupta. His modern values do not agree with those in Table 1 of
the paper.

In O. Pedersen’s A survey of the Almagest (pp. 423,424) the modern values
calculated for Ptolemy’s time are again different from those in this paper.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
1 am indebted to Dr. R. Billard for providing the modern values given in Table I.

SUDOKU-YANTRA
Sreeramula Rajeswara Sarma*
(Received 9 August, 2010)
Sudoku is a number puzzle where a grid of 9 x 9 cells is filled with
numbers 1 to 9 in such a way that the numbers do no repeat in any row, or
column, or a sub-grid of 3 x 3 columns. Introduced for the first time by The
Times of London on 12 November 2004, this number puzzle attained a phenomenal
popularity since then.1 Today there is hardly any newspaper or magazine that does not
offer these puzzles for the readers to solve. Although the use of this kind of arrangement
of numbers for recreational purposes is quite recent, it appears that this arrangement
was used much earlier in traditional India in the ritual or sacral context.
Among the papers of my grandfather Sreeramula Rajalinga Sastri, there
is a large sheet of paper2 on which a Mahâúîtalâ-pûjâ-yantra is drawn.
Superficially, this diagram (yantra) resembles the well-known Úrî-yantra or Úrî-
caktra.3 But in the present Úîtalâ-yantra, there are only two interlinking triangles
at the centre, which are surrounded by five annuli. As in the Úrî-yantra, here also
the whole drawing is enclosed in a square frame. The first, second and third annuli
are filled with 8, 12, 16 lotus petals respectively, and the spaces within the petals
and those between the petals are filled with mystic syllables (bîja-aks.aras). The
fourth annulus is filled entirely with such syllables. The fifth, and the outermost,
annulus contains a long invocation in Sanskrit, requesting the goddess to be
benevolent towards my grandfather and his family, to destroy the malefic spirits,
to prevent diseases and to confer long life and good health. While the diagram is
drawn with a graphite pencil, the letters are written in ink. The diagram is done
in a free hand without using a ruler for the straight lines or a pair of compasses
for the circles. (See Fig. 1). No date is mentioned on the sheet, but it must have
been prepared towards the end of the nineteenth century or the beginning of the
twentieth.
In the upper right hand corner of the sheet, there is a grid of 9 x 9 cells
which are filled with the numbers 1 to 9 exactly in the same manner as in a
* Höehenstrasse 28, 40227 Düsseldorf, Germany. e-mail: SR@Sarma.de.156
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
Sudoku, that is to say, the numbers are not repeated in any column or row, and
also not in any sub-grid of 3 x 3 cells. (See Fig. 2). The terminals of the horizontal
and vertical lines forming the grid are decorated with trident-like signs. At the top
of the grid is written vijaya (victory) thrice. A copying pencil was used here to
draw the grid and to write the numbers. The Telugu numerals with which the grid
was filled are rather different from the standard ones. It looks as if the grid was
added later on. It is certain that my grandfather, who was interested in Mantra-
sƒâstra, caused this addition to be made because he thought that this arrangement
of numbers had some connection with the Úîtalâ-yantra.
Recently R. C. Gupta published a very comprehensive study where he
discussed the mathematical basis of a large number of yantras. The only diagram
there which somewhat resembles the 9 x 9 grid on my grandfather’s Úîtalâ-
yantra is the Namokara-yantra with 5 x 5 cells filled with the numbers 1 to 5
in such a way that no number repeats itself in any row or column. 4 A similar grid
of 5 x 5 cells where the cells are filled with the five syllables na-mah.-úi-vâ-ya is
reproduced by Fredrick W. Bunce.5 These two are simple varieties of the so-
Fig. 1. Mahâúîtalâ-pûjâ-yantra157
HISTORICAL NOTES: SUDOKU YANTRA
called Latin Squares, where a square of n x n cells is filled with the numbers from
1 to n so that no number repeats itself in any row, column or diagonal.
But the 9 x 9 grid in my grandfather’s Úîtalâ-yantra has an additional
property, viz., that no number is repeated in any of the sub-grids of 3 x 3 cells.
Therefore it is mathematically more interesting and, as mentioned, it has exactly
the same arrangement as in the Sudoku puzzle. Occurring as it does in my
grandfather’s papers, this yantra must be part of an old tradition. I do not know
if it had any special name; I shall call it tentatively “Sudoku-yantra”.
It is not surprising that there is a sacred dimension to this specific
arrangement of the nine digits. In the highly numerate society of India, the interest
and pleasure in the arrangement of numbers developed, on the one hand, into the
mathematics of permutation and combination and, on the other hand, is reflected
in diverse ways in other aspects of life, including the religious, be it Hindu,
Buddhist or Jain. That is why some Vedic invocations are accompanied by a
series of decuple numbers from eka (100) to parârdha (1012); in the Buddhist
legend in the Lalitavistâra, Siddhârtha Gautama had to prove his prowess,
among others, in still higher powers of ten which go beyond the fiftieth decimal
place in order to win the hand of princess Gopâ; in the Jain cosmology, the
universe is defined quantitatively by means of yet higher orders of numbers. That
is also why prescriptions given in the Sƒulva-sûtras for the construction of sacrificial
fire altars involved advanced geometrical constructions, including what is now
Fig. 2. “Sudoku-yantra” (left) and my transcription (right)158
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
commonly known as the Pythagoras theorem, or at a later period the twenty-four
iconic forms of Vis.n.u (caturvim. úati-mûrtis) is developed purely on the basis of
the mathematical permutations by interchanging the four emblems of Vis.n.u in his
four hands.6
Likewise diagrams with specific geometric shapes such as the Úrî-yantra,
or diagrams with certain arrangements of syllables or numbers, played an important
role in the realm of Tantra. Contemplation on these diagrams (yantra)
accompanied by the utterance of certain mystic phrases (mantra) is supposed to
confer material and other-worldly benefits.
For historians of mathematics, on the other hand, these yantras provide
important clues for the development of mathematics. Therefore, it is necessary to
locate the textual sources for this Sudoku-yantra in the Tantra-úâstra. It is
published here with the hope that some scholar might be able to explain its ritual
background.

THE PULSATING INDIAN EPICYCLE
OF THE SUN
ANIL NARAYANAN*
(Received 17 February 2011; revised 30 June 2011)
The pulsating epicycle is a unique feature of ancient Indian
astronomy. An analysis of the pulsating epicycle was done and its
distinctive features were highlighted. Further, a comparison of Indian and
Greek epicycle systems was undertaken with regard to the orbit of the Sun
in the timeframe 100–2000 AD. Results showed that the Indian system is
far more accurate than the Greek. Finally a timeline analysis was conducted
which showed that the pulsating Indian epicycle for the Sun becomes
progressively more accurate as we move back in time. The maximum error
in solar longitude for the Indian epicycle dips down to the limit of precision
achievable with the naked eye in the timeframe 5000 - 5500 BC.
Key words: Almagest, Pulsating-Epicycle, Su–rya-Siddha–nta
1. INTRODUCTION
The epicycle is one feature that is common to both Indian and Greek
astronomies of old. Today it is well known that the shape of all planetary orbits
is an ellipse and that the planets move around the Sun, not the Earth. The ancients
however, being unaware of these facts, assumed these orbits to be circular and
the Earth to be the center of the universe. Thus they were puzzled at the movements
of the planets and of the Sun and Moon. At times these bodies would appear
nearer, then farther, sometimes moving slowly and at other times faster, and most
perplexing of all - at times some planets were seen going in reverse. To explain
these varied phenomena they developed an ingenious geometric orbital model, the
so-called epicyclical system, which could explain these variations in orbital speed
and position for the heavenly bodies. For nearly 1400 years this model dominated
all astronomy in Europe till the middle of the second millennium when the elliptical

nature of planetary orbits was finally established and the epicyclical system
abandoned for good.
Fig. 1a shows the basic components of an epicyclical system. It consists
of a smaller circle (the epicycle), on which the planet moves and a larger circle
(the deferent) over which the epicycle itself moves. By varying the sizes of the two
circles and the speeds of the planet and epicycle, it is possible to obtain a variety
of orbital shapes1, some of which are shown in Fig. 1b. The orbital shape that
concerns us in this article is the ellipse. It is a well-known result that an ellipse of
any shape can be created from a suitable epicyclical system. The converse however
is not true.
Apart from the geometrical aspects, the epicycle has another side to it. It
has the dubious distinction of being at the center of an east-west historical
controversy. In the 19th century the colonial English masters of India, no doubt
following the dictum that rulers cannot afford to look inferior to the ruled, put forth
the hypothesis that Indian astronomy was borrowed wholesale from their European
cousins, the Greeks. Their argument was made through doubtful and occasionally
bizarre conjectures arising from twisting of facts coupled with a stratagem of
ignoring any evidence to the contrary. The epicycle, being common to both Indian
and Greek systems, was the pièce-de-résistance of their case. Now though
present in both, a detailed study of the epicycle in the two systems reveals several
Fig. 1. The Epicyclical system413
PULSATING INDIAN EPICYCLE OF THE SUN
important variances. Indeed, the differences in implementation are so great that it
negates any notions of wholesale borrowing to have taken place from Greece to
India or vice-versa. As we will shortly demonstrate, the Indian epicycle system is
subtle, elegantly conceived and far more accurate than the combination of eccentrics
and epicycles the Greeks could muster.
It is however not the aim of this paper to compare Indian and Greek
epicycles in an exhaustive manner. Herein we will focus mainly on the Indian and
Greek epicycles for the Sun.
2. THE PULSATING INDIAN EPICYCLE
The Indian astronomical system has two schemes for describing planetary
orbits: (1) single-epicycle and (2) dual-epicycle. The former is simpler and is
applied to the orbits of the Sun and the Moon. The latter is more complex and
is used for the orbits of the five visible planets. In this paper we will confine
ourselves to the simpler single-epicycle system.
Compared to the constant-radius Greek one, the Indian epicycle has the
remarkable feature that it contracts and expands (pulsates) as it moves on the
deferent. This is shown pictorially in Fig. 2. The epicycle starts out moving
counterclockwise from the apogee (A). At this point the planet is farthest from the
Fig. 2. The Pulsating Epicycle414
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
Earth and the epicycle has its maximum radius (Ra). Note that the planet moves
in the opposite direction (clockwise) on the epicycle. As the epicycle moves, its
radius shrinks continuously till it reaches quadrature (B), where it attains its minimum
radius (Rb). After crossing point B, the epicycle begins expanding till it reaches
the perigee (P), where the planet is closest to the Earth and the epicycle has
regained its maximum radius (Ra). This scheme then repeats to D and then back
to A.
The pulsating system as described above obviously represents a significant
advancement over the simple constant-radius epicycle. The intent behind it is also
plainly evident. It would appear that the ancient Indian astronomer had fully
comprehended that a simple epicycle, as shown in Fig. 1a, was inadequate to
portray with sufficient accuracy the actual motion of the heavenly body. Thus he
conceived of an additional feature to the basic epicycle in the form of a pulsation
(expanding/contracting), which gave a significantly closer fit to his observational
data.
A principal question in the pulsating system is this – at what rate does the
pulsation occur? We may be surprised if in our arrogance we were to expect
these ancient people to employ something simple - like a linear variation perhaps,
because there is further complexity in store. The actual variation of pulsation used
is not linear, but a sine function. At first glance that may appear an unnecessary
twist in an already complex scheme. However, as it turns out, that is the crux of
the entire system. This sinusoidal variation of pulsation generates a planetary path
that closely corresponds to a combination of conjoined ellipses2.
3. ANALYSIS
For this paper the Indian text we will refer is the Su–rya-Siddha–nta3, the
most revered of ancient astronomical works of India. Also, as mentioned, we will
confine ourselves to the single-epicycle scheme - the one that deals with the orbits
of the Sun and the Moon. On the Greek side we will refer to the great work
authored by Ptolemy called the Mathematical Syntaxis, sometimes also referred
as the Almagest4.
3.1. The Inequalities
To the very ancient people, the Sun and the Moon appeared to be moving
in uniform circular orbits around the Earth; at least they assumed it so. Since415
PULSATING INDIAN EPICYCLE OF THE SUN
however the actual orbit of these bodies is elliptical, there obviously arose a
discrepancy between the assumption of uniform circular motion and actual
observational data. The heavenly body seemed at times to be nearer to the Earth
and at other times farther away. Also, when nearer it appeared to be moving
faster and when farther its motion was visibly slower. This set of discrepancies,
that showed a departure from uniform circular motion, was termed the ‘First
Inequality’.
Fig. 3. The Simple Epicycle and Eccentric
The simple epicycle model shown in Fig. 3 solves this problem of the First
Inequality. In this scheme, an epicycle of constant radius Ra moves on a deferent
with radius R with the condition that the two angular velocities ωp and ωep, of the
planet and the epicycle respectively, are equal. The Earth (E) is situated at the
center of the deferent.
The parametric equations of the deferent circle are:
X = R cos (α)
…(1)
Y = R sin (α)
…(2)
The apsidal line, which is the line joining the apogee (A) and perigee (P)
of the orbit, lies on the X-axis. The two angular velocities ωp and ωep being equal,416
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
the arcs SM and ON will always be equal i.e. angles ∠NEO and ∠SNM are
always equal. From basic geometrical principles we see that this simple epicycle
scheme has the unique property that the line (NM) drawn from the center of the
epicycle to the planet is always parallel to the apsidal line or X-axis. Thus the X-
coordinate of the planet always maintains a difference of Ra with that of the center
of the epicycle while the Y-coordinate of the planet remains identical with that of
the epicycle center.
Therefore we can write the parametric equations of the planet’s path as:
X = R cos (α) + Ra
…(3)
Y = R sin (α)
…(4)
It is seen from Eqns. (3) and (4) that the resultant orbit of the planet is
a circle with the same dimensions as that of the deferent, with the difference that
the center of the planet’s orbit circle is displaced along the X-axis by an amount
equal to the radius of the epicycle Ra. This orbit is shown pictorially in Fig. 3 by
a dashed line. The geometric name for such a displaced circle is the ‘Eccentric’
(an off-center circle) and thus this scheme is also sometimes referred to as ‘Equation
of the Center’. At point A, the planet is farther away from the Earth and thus it
appears to move slower, while at point P it is closer and appears to move faster.
Thus this model neatly explains the discrepancies of the First Inequality. For
ellipses of low eccentricity this Eccentric scheme yields a fairly good approximation
of the orbit, and indeed both the Sun and Moon have orbits of low eccentricity
-0.0167 and 0.0549 respectively.
Fig. 4 shows, for illustrative purposes only, a comparison of mean and
true longitudes of three types of orbits - uniform circular, eccentric and elliptic.
For uniform circular motion the mean and true longitudes are always equal and
so its graph is a straight line. For the eccentric and elliptic orbits, the planet’s
speed is slowest at apogee. Thus the true longitude starts falling behind the mean
from that point. However after leaving the apogee the planet picks up speed as
seen by the rising slope in the two cases and by perigee the true longitude has
caught up with the mean. After perigee the planet’s true longitude overtakes the
mean, but now its speed is falling. This falling speed eventually lets the mean
longitude catch up with the true so that by the time the apogee is reached, the
mean and true longitudes are equal once again. Note that a high value of elliptic
eccentricity was chosen for this figure since it is for illustrative purposes only. For417
PULSATING INDIAN EPICYCLE OF THE SUN
realistic orbital eccentricities of the Sun or Moon, which are quite low, the difference
between the eccentric and elliptic orbits will be too small to be discernable in this
graph.
We note from Fig. 4 that the simple epicycle orbit (i.e. eccentric) matches
exactly with the elliptic orbit at only two points – the apogee and the perigee. At
all other points it is off by various amounts. These additional discrepancies between
calculated (eccentric) and actual (elliptic) longitudes are called the second inequality,
third inequality and so on. Both the Greeks and the Indians have handled these
secondary inequalities by introducing complexities in the simple epicycle model of
Fig. 3.
Fig. 4. Variation of Mean and True longitudes for various orbits
For the Sun’s motion, the Greeks appear to have been satisfied with the
simple eccentric model of Fig. 3. Three centuries before Ptolemy, Hipparchus is
known to have used that simple model and Ptolemy adopted it with almost no
modification. Ptolemy gives the ratio between the deferent and epicycle radii as
120:5, which creates a center offset of 1 in 24. In later sections of this paper we
will be studying this Greek model in detail and examine its accuracy in predicting
the Sun’s longitudinal motion.
Lunar motion is complex enough to warrant a separate article and so we
will not continue further on the subject here except to make a few remarks in418
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
passing. The Greek Lunar model is quite complex. It also suffers from significant
inaccuracies - so much so that Ptolemy himself did not employ it in his eclipse
calculations. The Indian lunar epicycle model does not suffer such substantial
inaccuracies and the eclipse calculation in the Indian system derives the Moon’s
apparent diameter from its own Indian lunar model.
3.2. The Indian Solution
Fig. 5 shows the pulsating Indian epicycle scheme in detail. The epicycle
starts out from the apogee A, where the planet is on the far side at V on the
epicycle. At this point it is farthest from the earth (E). As it moves counterclockwise,
the epicycle’s radius contracts till it reaches a minimum at the quadrature C. The
planet meanwhile is moving clockwise on the epicycle with an angular velocity that
is equal to that of the epicycle on the deferent.
Fig. 5. The Pulsating Indian Epicycle Scheme
The center of the epicycle moves on the deferent whose parametric
equations are:
X = R cos (α)
…(5)
Y = R sin (α)
…(6)
...where R is the radius of the deferent.419
PULSATING INDIAN EPICYCLE OF THE SUN
As explained earlier, in this scheme the line joining the center of the
epicycle to the planet will always remain parallel to the apsidal line or the X-axis.
Due to this, the Y-coordinate of the planet will be identical with that of the
epicycle center at all times. The X-coordinate of the planet will be offset from that
of the center of the epicycle by an amount that equals the radius of the epicycle.
But note that unlike the eccentric case, the epicycle radius in the pulsating model
is not a constant. It varies with position (or the anomaly angle α).
Denoting the instantaneous radius of the epicycle at any arbitrary angle α
as Rα, the planetary orbital parametric equations become:
X = R cos (α) + Rα
…(7)
Y = R sin (α)
…(8)
As mentioned, had Rα been a constant (a constant-radius epicycle), the
resultant planetary orbit would have been an eccentric circle. However in the
present case there is a pulsation, which decreases and increases the radius Rα.
We now turn to the Indian text instructions for determining Rα.
Given a mean planet position, the first step in the process is the
determination of the quadrant sequence number. This number indicates how many
quadrants away from the apogee the mean planet is located. The text instructions
are as follows:
Correct the planet’s mean longitude with respect to the apsis
The remainder is its anomaly from which is found the quadrant.
- Chap 2, Verse 29
Having thus found the quadrant, the next step is to determine the
instantaneous epicycle radius at that point in the orbit, for which we are first
required to establish the base-sine:
In an odd quadrant, the base-sine is taken from the part past, etc;
But in an even quadrant the base-sine is taken from the part to come
- Chap 2, Verse 30
Table 1 below shows the base-sine details for the four quadrants. Angle
α is measured counter-clockwise from the positive X-axis as usual.420
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
The final verses for determination of the corrected epicycle dimension are
as follows:
Multiply the base-sine by the difference of the epicycles at the odd
and even quadrants and divide that by radius;
The result when applied to the even epicycle, additive or subtractive
according to as this is lesser or greater than the odd, gives the corrected
epicycle.
- Chap 2, Verse 38
For the single-epicycle scheme (i.e. those for the Sun and Moon), the
even epicycle is always greater than the odd (i.e. Ra > Rb). Thus the ‘result’ in
the above verse will have to be subtracted from the even epicycle to obtain the
corrected epicycle.
In other words:
Rα = Ra - (Ra-Rb) sin (α)
… for quadrants Q1 and Q2
…(9)
Rα = Ra - (Ra-Rb) (-sin (α))
… for quadrants Q3 and Q4
…(10)
Simplifying, we have:
Rα = Ra - ∆r sin (α)
… for quadrants Q1 and Q2
…(11)
Rα = Ra + ∆r sin (α)
… for quadrants Q3 and Q4
…(12)
...where ∆r = Ra-Rb, is the difference between the epicycles at the end of the
even and odd quadrants.
Substituting Eqns. (11) and (12) into Eqns. (7) and (8), the parametric equations
of the pulsating epicycle orbit become:
X = R cos (α) - ∆r sin (α) + Ra
… for quadrants Q1 and Q2
…(13)
X = R cos (α) + ∆r sin (α) + Ra
… for quadrants Q3 and Q4
Y = R sin (α)

PULSATING INDIAN EPICYCLE OF THE SUN
Using Eqns. (13) and (14), we can now proceed to compute a planet’s
actual position in its orbit with respect to its mean anomaly. In the next section
we will do that for the orbit of the Sun.
4. THE SUN’S ORBIT - COMPARING GREEK AND INDIAN EPICYCLES
The orbit of the Sun makes a simple case for comparing Indian and Greek
epicycle systems as described above. Though an ellipse, the eccentricity of this
orbit is so small that it is very close to being a circle. The Greek model, which
is a simple epicycle equivalent to an eccentric, yielded satisfactory results as far
as the Greeks were concerned. It would be interesting to test the Indian model
on the Sun’s orbit and in the process discover why the ancient Indians were
unsatisfied by the accuracy of the simple epicycle and chose to employ the
pulsating scheme instead.
For the Sun, Ptolemy has used a deferent-epicycle combination with radii
of 120 and 5 units respectively. We will use the same deferent radius (120 units)
for the Indian epicycle. The maximum and minimum radii of the pulsating Indian
epicycle for the Sun then work out to be 4.6667 and 4.5556 units respectively.
Fig. 6. Indian and Greek Error Curves for the Sun’s Longitude
Next, to determine the Sun’s actual longitude we will employ well-known empirical
formulae in current use5. These formulae are accurate to within 0.01 degrees and
are quite sufficient for our current needs. By subtracting the values predicted by422
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
Indian and Greek systems from the Sun’s actual longitude we obtain the error
curves for Indian and Greek systems.
Fig. 6 shows the result of the above effort. It shows the Indian and Greek
error curves at two epochs: 2000AD and 100 AD. The latter epoch was chosen
keeping in mind the approximate time of Ptolemy. It can be seen from the figure
that the Greek solar model yields fairly good results - the maximum error in
longitude is 30 minutes or half-a-degree in 2000AD and 24 minutes in 100 AD.
The equivalent curves in the figure for the pulsating Indian epicycle are seen to
provide a substantial improvement over the Greek. For the 100 AD epoch, the
maximum Indian error is only about 10½ minutes - less than half of the Greek.
Having tested the Indian and Greek models at Ptolemy’s epoch of 100
AD, next we will attempt to test the Indian model for more ancient times. Some
scholars6,7 believe the original Su–rya-Siddha–nta to have been composed between
3000 BC and 8000 BC, though most modern scholars place the available version
of the text at about 1000 AD. We shall therefore move backwards in time in steps
of 1000 years starting from 2000 AD till 10000 BC and determine the Solar error
curves for the Indian model at each epoch. Fig. 7 shows the result of the above
effort. It is very interesting, not to mention pleasantly surprising, to observe that
the Indian epicycle grows progressively more accurate as we move back in time.

PULSATING INDIAN EPICYCLE OF THE SUN
Fig. 8. Variation of Maximum Solar Longitudinal Error with Time for the Pulsating Indian
Epicycle
A minimum value for Solar longitudinal error (less than 2 minutes of arc) appears
to be reached near the 5000 BC epoch.
It would be useful to further analyze the above results by examining the
variation of maximum solar error on each curve in Fig. 7 versus time. Fig. 8 shows
the result of that endeavor. Some additional computation was done to examine in
detail the period between 5000 BC and 5500 BC in steps of 100 years. It can
be seen from Fig. 8 that the maximum error in solar longitude drops down to just
over 1 minute at 5200 BC. This is certainly a striking result because 1 minute is
near the limit of precision achievable with the naked eye. It is made all the more
remarkable when we consider the fact that the Sun is extraordinarily difficult to
observe with great accuracy.
5. DISCUSSION
While all western historians concede that the ancient Indians were very
advanced in mathematics and geometry, they do not admit the same in the field
of astronomy. Given that mathematics, geometry and astronomy are closely related,
this is certainly a very curious thing. They trace this conclusion of Indian
backwardness in astronomy to deductions made by the colonial English, nearly
150 years ago, which stated that the ancient Indians were poor observers of the
sky.424
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
The findings in this paper stand in total conflict with the above western
conclusion. Even for the 100 AD timeframe, supposedly the peak of Greek
achievements in astronomy, the pulsating Indian epicycle for the Sun is seen to be
twice as better as the Greek model, while for very ancient times, possibly the
actual epoch of the Su–rya-Siddha–nta (3000 – 8000 BC), its accuracy is
unprecedented.
Naturally one may harbor this question – is this accuracy of the Indian
epicycle merely a mathematical coincidence? Is it mere happenstance that the
model predicts with a 1-minute accuracy the actual solar motion at the 5200 BC
epoch?
As seen from the author’s earlier paper7, the ancient Indians did not
hesitate to state explicitly the precision of their data. Thus it is possible that a
1-minute precision can indeed be expected for data obtained using the pulsating
epicycle technique. So we may conclude with reasonable confidence from Fig. 8
that the Su–rya-Siddha–nta’s current epicycle parameters for the Sun were set in
the 5200 BC timeframe or thereabouts.
Interestingly, as far back as 1896, Brennand6 had these thoughts about
the Sun’s orbital parameters in the Su–rya-Siddha–nta:
“At the beginning of the present century, according to Laplace,
the greatest equation of the Sun’s center was 1°55′27.7′′ and this
diminished at the rate of 16.9"" in a century; the difference between these
two values of the greatest equation = 904.3"", which divided by 16.9"" gives
5351 years to have elapsed up to the beginning of AD 1800, since the
greatest equation of the center had the value given to it in the Su–rya-
Siddha–nta.”
In other words, Brennand states the epoch of the Su–rya-Siddha–nta’s
solar epicycle parameters to be near about 3500 BC.
Clearly the ancient Indian astronomer must have possessed a great deal
of very accurate solar data to be able to create a geometric model so close to
actuality. Observing the Sun with such accuracy is no easy matter. We can today
only speculate about the methods and instruments he had at his disposal to
accomplish this. We salute his ingenuity, not only in observation but also in devising
the elegantly conceived pulsating epicycle.425
PULSATING INDIAN EPICYCLE OF THE SUN
6. CONCLUSIONS
Conclusions that may be drawn from this study of the pulsating Indian
epicycle are as follows:
1. For determining the Sun’s longitude, the pulsating Indian epicycle is far more
accurate than the Greek eccentric-epicycle model.
2. The pulsating Indian epicycle for the Sun becomes progressively more accurate
as one goes back in time. Peak accuracy, of about 1 minute of arc, is reached
around 5200 BC.
3. The current values of the Su–rya-Siddha–nta’s pulsating epicycle parameters
for the Sun appear to have been set in the 5000-5500 BC timeframe.
4. A central hypothesis of western historians, that the ancient Indians were poor
observers, stands disproved by the findings in this paper.

Abstract
The principle and results of mathematics are universal and immutable, or so we believe: the
principles are those which guide logical thought and the results emerge from their applications to
abstractions encoding the world around us, primarily numbers (arithmetic) and space (geometry). There
are, nevertheless, significant variations in the practice of mathematics in different cultures. Where India
is concerned, several cultural traits, spanning its entire geography and history – northwest India in the
earliest Vedic period to Kerala in the 16th century – can be identified. The present article is a preliminary,
largely non-technical, inquiry into the roots of these unifying traits. The most pervasive influence seems
to have been that of an oral and nominal mode of articulating and transmitting knowledge, in other words
that of spoken language. Examples are given to illustrate how the resulting challenges to the doing of
mathematics, generally considered to be an abstract and symbolic science, were accommodated or
overcome, especially interesting being the impact of nominalism on decimal counting and on the notions
of zero and infinity. Other topics discussed include the Indian approach to geometry and its differences
from the Hellenic, the idea of proof in India and its evolution, and the flood of new ideas in 15th and 16th
century Kerala which foreshadowed the modern mathematical mainstream. Some remarks are also offered
on possible mutual influences across different cultures.
Key words and phrases: Cross-cultural transmission; Diagonal theorem; Excluded middle;

1. ONE THEOREM, THREE CULTURES
To begin with, one has to ask what
meaning beyond that of mere geographical
association can be attached to the phrase “Indian
mathematics” in my title. Before attempting to
identify or even speak about whatever it is that is
distinctively Indian in Indian mathematics, we
must first be convinced that such a distinction is a
meaningful one. This is an issue that has not had
a great deal of focussed attention paid to it though
historians of mathematics have often taken
positions, generally subconsciously, on either side
of the divide: ‘mathematics in India’ as opposed
to ‘the mathematics of India’. The former position
accepts that the discipline of mathematics is a
universally identifiable activity of the human
mind, individually and collectively, the finest
attestation of its capacity to reason things through
minutely and precisely. It is the canonical view,
for the very good reason that history largely
vindicates it. Everyone may not be in agreement
on a good characterisation of what this universality
consists in and what its cognitive basis might be,
but we all recognise the beast when we see it. To
take a widely known example (and one which has
special significance for India), the statement that
32 + 42 = 52 is a true mathematical statement,
recognised as such by even those who may not
know why it has a deeper significance than say
something like 3 + 4 = 7. Related to it in no

immediately obvious way is the equally clearly
mathematical (and true) statement: In a rectangle,
the area of the square whose side is its diagonal is
the same as the sum of the areas of the squares
whose sides are the two sides of the rectangle.
The connection between the two is that, together,
they imply that in a rectangle of sides 3 and 4 units,
the length of the diagonal is a whole number, 5;
or, equivalently, if a triangle has sides of 3, 4 and
5 units, the angle opposite 5 is a right angle. The
geometric statement about areas is the diagonal
theorem (those who are uncomfortable with this
name can replace ‘diagonal’ by ‘Pythagorean’)1
first formulated, in more or less the language I
have employed, in the middle-late Vedic
achitectural/geometric workbooks known as the
Śulbasūtra (ca. 800 BC; Baudhāyana,
Āpastamba). The numbers 3, 4 and 5 are the
smallest examples of triples of whole numbers
which have this geometric property and there are
an infinite number of such triples. Diagonal triples
go back a thousand years earlier and several
thousand kilometers further west, occurring first
on Mesopotamian clay tablets of the Old
Babylonian period, around 1800 BC. The point
for us is that this circle of ideas was seen as true
and good mathematics as much in 19th century
BC Mesopotamia as in 9th century BC India and
6th century BC (or perhaps a little later) Greece.
There are any number of other instances in which
pretty much the same mathematical developments,
ranging from sharply defined individual results
to whole new theoretical structures, have come
up in disparate cultural backgrounds widely
separated in space and time.
It would seem to be obvious then that if
there is sense in invoking cultural qualifiers like
‘Indian’ or ‘Mesopotamian’ in relation to
mathematics, it cannot refer to its substance but
only to such intangibles as the value attached to
mathematical activity, the manner in which
mathematical discoveries were motivated and
made, thought about, made use of and so on; in
other words, to the cultural matrix in which this
whole body of thought, mathematics, was situated.
The way three different civilisations dealt with the
diagonal theorem and diagonal triples (‘the
Pythagorean paradigm’ in a convenient though
historically misleading short phrase) already
serves as the first sign-posts to what we might look
for. The Babylonians wrote their mathematics
down on durable material from which we learn
that they knew some diagonal triples and also the
geometric theorem for the special case of the
square (which says that the square on the diagonal
of the square has twice the area of the square on
the side): there is a well-known tablet with the
inscribed value of √2, the length of the diagonal,
written in Babylonian sexagesimal figure of a
square with its diagonals and an excellent
approximation of the number notation; there are
even figures of nested squares (on another tablet)
which might have provided a visual demonstration
of its truth. (The choice of the base for counting:
60 in Babylonia, 10 in India and none in Greece,
is itself an interesting cultural differentiator). No
statement of the geometric theorem (even for the
square) has so far been brought to light. General
geometric statements are not a strength of
Babylonian mathematics but there is a remarkable
tablet with a problem requring repeated use of
triples to find a diagonal in three dimensions in
an architectural context.
Pythagoras had a statement of the general
geometric theorem and perhaps a demonstration
of it, according to later, sometimes much later,
Greek sources – their word is all we have for it,
no textual material survived – but he probably did
not have a list of triples. The pre-Euclid history of
the Greek version of the theorem is murky and
1 No theorem in Indian mathematics is named after an individual, no matter how revered. The diagonal theorem which remained
nameless for a long time eventually came to be called bhujā-koi-kar a-nyāya; kar a is the diagonal of a rectangle or, equiva-
lently, the hypotenuse of a right triangle.58
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
what we know about its Greek enunci-ation and
proof is essentially what is in Euclid (4th century
BC). Much had changed in Greek intellectual life
in the preceding two centuries and the Euclidean
transformation of geometry into a rigorously
axiomatic science was the most dazzling of the
triumphs of the resulting deductive approach to
the acquisition of knowledge. This is a very well
known story as is the fact that when Europe
rediscovered its Greek intellectual heritage in the
middle of the second millennium AD, Euclidean
geometry became the embodiment of the ideal to
which all mathematical work aspired. Thus did
the idea of a universe of ‘pure’ mathematics,
sufficient unto itself, come into being and, in
course of time, grow into the vigorous and
apparently limitless enterprise that it is now. The
theorem of Pythagoras remained and still remains
an essential ingredient in many branches of
mathematics – it is the foundation of all notions
of distance in geometry – but for Euclid it was
one among the many results that followed from
his definitions and supposedly universally valid
postulates through the exercise of equally
unquestioned rules of logical reasoning. Euclid
also brought the Pythagorean paradigm to a
satisfactory conclusion: he had a general formula
that produced all triples.
Indian geometry has been from the
beginning less ‘pure’ than its Greek counterpart,
making generous room within it for the
mensurational (the ‘metric’ in geometry) aspects
of the study of space: lengths of lines and,
especially, areas of closed figures. The two facets
of the diagonal paradigm together made for a
perfect setting for the practice of this not-so-pure
geometry or, perhaps, it happened the other way,
the practice came first; in any case the Pythagorean
paradigm set the direction for Indian geometry and
remained its defining theme for as long as it lived.
Already in the first propositions on the subject
(Baudhāyana and Āpastamba), equal weight is
given to the statement of the abstract theorem
(along the lines cited above) and to a collection of
(not too large) triples. In fact one of the later
Śulbasūtras (of Mānava, who probably lived at
about the same time as Pythagoras) has a way of
generating an infinite subclass of triples through
a special case of Euclid’s formula. We also know
that the theorem and the triples were put to a
practical and ritually important use, that of making
right angles in the floor plans of altars (vedi).
The mechanisms of oral transmission of
knowledge in Vedic India were very much more
robust than they were in Pythagorean Greece (and
have remained robust throughout history) and it
is to this fact that we owe the survival of the
Śulbasūtra texts. Their faithfulness to the originals
is not in question, but their highly compressed
sūtra format makes it almost certain that
everything that their authors knew was not set
down, though very likely to have been passed on
down the generations. The old cliché, “absence
of proof is not proof of absence”, is particularly
apt here: there are no proofs in these texts.
Supplying proofs of the diagonal theorem, of
varying degrees of ingenuity and elegance, has
always been a staple of Indian mathematical
history. The simpler ones tend to be
diagrammatically prettier and there is no reason
to doubt the opinion of the pioneering scholars of
these texts that they served as visually convincing
demonstrations of its truth. The compulsions of
the axiomatic method would have made them
unacceptable to Euclid; his own proof is visually
unenlightening, as some of us may remember from
our school days. And that illustrates another of
the cultural differentiators of Indian and Greek
geometry and, more generally, mathematics: what
constitutes a proof, a verifiable demonstration, a
yukti in the sense employed by Nīlakaha, the
great 15th-16th century polymath from Kerala?
The focus in this article will naturally be
on India, with Greek and later European work on
related themes serving as the parallel mathematical
universe for purposes of comparison. It must be
borne firmly in mind that traditional mathematicalWHAT IS INDIAN ABOUT INDIAN MATHEMATICS?
59
scholarship in India came effectively to an end
with the arrival of European colonial powers, say
in the second half of the 16th century, at about the
same time as the Greek-inspired mathematical
rejuvenation of Europe took off. Formed as we
are in the extraordinarily fruitful culture that is
today’s mathematical mainstream, it is not easy
for us to keep our modernity aside while trying to
penetrate the minds of the authors of the
Śulbasūtra, or of an Āryabhaa or a Mādhava for
that matter. Moreover, any enquiry into the
unifying ideas that run through the enterprise of
creating, validating and communicating
mathematical knowledge will necessarily intrude
into alien territory: logic and philosophy,
linguistics, cultural history, etc., especially
important in the Indian context being the
primordial role of language and grammar in giving
purpose and form to our mathematics, its Indian
flavour as it were. The notes that follow are to be
thought of as no more than a selective (and largely
non-technical) account, illustrated by the simplest
possible examples, of a very tentative first effort
in that direction.
2. THE GEOGRAPHY OF INDIAN MATHEMATICS
Mathematics in India has a long and
continuous history. Going by textual evidence
alone, the earliest example of mathematical
creativity is the invention of a complete and
systematic method of counting with 10 as the base
(decimal enumeration) and the evidence,
enormous quantities of it, comes from an
unexpected source, the gveda. The gveda has
close to three thousand number names distributed
among all its ten Books, the supposedly early as
well as the later Books I and X (Book VIII, one of
the early ‘Clan Books’, is particularly rich in
them). Postponing a closer look to the next section,
here the author only note two points: i) the almost
perfect regularity of the structure of the number
names can only mean that the decimal system was
well established already by the time the individual
poems of the early Books were composed; and ii)
the consensus among Vedic philologists is that the
final redaction of the gveda in the form in which
it is known today more or less – via Śākalya,
Sāyaa, et al. – happened around 1200 - 1100 BC
and that the earliest individual poems are to be
dated a few centuries prior to it. The two points
together mean that the perfecting of the decimal
number system took place in tandem with the final
stages of the evolution of Vedic grammar and the
mathematically more interesting invention of the
rules of metrically ordered verse. As for when and
where: around 1400 BC give or take a century,
wherever in northwest India the Vedic people were
at that time.
The earliest Śulbasūtras were compiled
further east, in the Kuru country around Delhi.
After that there was a long break in significant
mathematical activity until we come to the last
centuries BC which saw a tremendous revival of
interest in numbers and their potential infinitude,
especially (but not only) among Jainas and
Buddhists. To roughly the same period belongs
Pigala, whose combinatorial investigation of
prosody began with Vedic metres and ended up in
the complete theoretical classification of all
possible metres in a syllabary with two durations,
guru and laghu, for each syllable, an achievement
of the highest order. We do not know where he
lived.
Around the 3rd century AD, the nature of
mathematical activity began to change. Contacts
with the Hellenic world, especially Alexandria in
Egypt, brought into India the quantitative study
of astronomical observations and the making of
geometric models of planetary motion. This was
a first; the idea of subjecting natural phenomena
to mathematical analysis – the very foundation of
modern science – whose results in turn could be
used to predict events which had not yet come to
pass was not part of Indian intellectual tradition
and, later, it never was extended to other sciences
than astronomy. In any case, astronomy became60
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
the driving force behind mathematical innovation
to a very great extent, a privilged role it retained
until the end. The Greek influence probably
entered through Gandhara along with much else
that was Greek but took firm root in the Malava
region during the 4th and 5th centuries (the
Siddhanta period, on account of several competing
astronomical systems or siddhāntas). The last
Siddhāntist was Varāhamihira (Ujjain, 6th century)
but just before that Āryabhaa had already
announced himself at Kusumapura in Magadha
far to the east, where he composed his eponymous
masterpiece bringing together Alexandrian
astronomy and Indian geometry in a remarkable
synthesis. The Āryabhaīya (499 AD) defined the
direction that mathematical astronomy and
mathematics itself were to take in India, much as
Pāini’s Aādhyāyī did for Sanskrit grammar and
grammatical theory in general.
The Aryabhatan revolution inaugurated a
period of extraordinarily rich and diverse
mathematical achievements and it lasted until
creative mathematics came to an end in a blaze of
glory, in Kerala. In between, outstandingly good
mathematicians popped up in virtually every
region of cultural India. To name only the most
influential, we have Bhāskara I and Brahmagupta
(both 7th century) in western India and Bhāskara
II (Bhāskarācārya) in the northern Deccan (12th
century) sandwiching between them some fine
mathematicians working in various parts of north
India; Mahāvīra (9th century) and Nārāyaa (14th
century) in the southern Deccan; the Chera royal
astronomer Śañkaranārāyaa and his teacher
Govindasvāmi (9th century) from almost the
southern tip of Kerala; and finally the remarkable
school established by Mādhava of which
Nīlakaha and Jyehadeva were prominent
members, also in Kerala but further north in the
Nila river basin (14th - 16th centuries). The
centuries after Āryabhaa also saw the first
documented transmission of mathematics from
India to the Baghdad Caliphate, to China and to
southeast Asia; the first surviving examples of
positionally written decimal numbers, including
a zero symbol in the form of a small circle, are in
Sanskrit inscriptions from Cambodia (7th
century).
One purpose of my running through the
names of the chief protagonists in the story of
Indian mathematics and their theatres of action,
however sketchily, is to provide background for
what follows: the names will help set the scene.
The overriding impression, however, is not of how
they differed one from another but how closely
they were linked, over this vast span of time and
geographical distance, by a sense of continuity in
conceptual framework and technical apparatus.
There is an identifiable DNA and it can be traced
all the way back, in spite of the many mutations
along the way such as those brought about by the
great breakthroughs of an Āryabhaa or a
Brahmagupta or a Mādhava. To cite only two out
of many examples, while Āryabhaa’s
trigonometry and Brahmagupta’s geometry of
cyclic quadrilaterals are quite distinct in their goals
and the means by which they were attained, their
seeds are clearly discernible in the Śulbasūtra. The
second example, even more dramatic, is
Mādhava’s invention of calculus for trigonometric
functions: the trigonometry is Āryabhaa’s but the
crucial infinitsimal input relies on a much earlier
idea, the recognition that numbers have no end.
There are excellent historical reasons for
this uniformity of thought and method.
Throughout histoy Indian mathematicians, like
many other Indians – traders, pilgrims and
proselytisers of new faiths, learned people,
architects and artisans, soldiers and those seeking
to evade them, etc. etc. – took to the road readily,
often over very long distances, and the knowledge
in their minds travelled with them. Plenty has been
written about the gradual movement eastwards of
the Vedic people, occupying most of the Ganga
basin by the time of the Buddha, but Āryabhaa
was not descended from that stock. He was fromWHAT IS INDIAN ABOUT INDIAN MATHEMATICS?
61
Aśmaka (“aśmakīya” and “aśmaka-janapada-
jāta” according to Bhāskara I and Nīlakaha)
some thousands of kilometers to the west; the
plausible scenario is that he or his immediate
ancestors were refugees from the invading Hunas,
part of a great mid-5th century migration that also
carried Mahayana Buddhism from its stronghold
in Gandhara and thereabouts to less endangered
areas of Gupta India, in particular eastern India.
Bhāskara II’s birth was near the modern town of
Chalisgaon in northern Maharashtra but there is
an inscription put up there by his grandson tracing
the family back five generations to a paternal
ancestor in the court of Raja Bhoja of Dhar – who,
we may recall, fought Mahmud of Ghazni – in
Malava. There is in fact a striking absence of
‘published’ mathematics (or astronomy)
attributable to north India after the Afghan
invasions and until the end of the 16th century.
Mathematical learning became confined, by and
large, to southern India.
But it was the same mathematics. Well
before the time of the Afghan raids,
Govindasvāmi, a devoted follower of Bhāskara I,
and through him of Āryabhaa, was in Kerala,
surely as part of the early wave of Brahmin settlers
brought to the coast of Karnataka and Kerala by
local kings and chieftains. The identified sources
of these migrations are Ahicchatra on the Ganga
and Valabhi in Gujarat where Bhāskara I probably
taught. And the fact that Mādhava was a Tulu
Brahmin, a recent arrival in the Nila valley from
coastal Karnataka, itself a place of settlement of
northern Brahmins, only serves to reinforce the
northern connection further.
Textual and other internal evidence, as
much as the mathematical content, fully vindicates
the idea of a community of scholars scattered in
various parts of India at various times but
connected together in a permanent intellectual
network, holding on to their traditional knowledge
systems and the language, Sanskrit, in which the
knowledge was expressed and preserved. Every
student, no matter where he lived, began his
studies with Sanskrit and its grammar before
moving on to the specialised texts composed by
his great predecessors, the pūrvācārya, no matter
how far back in the past or how re-mote
geographically. Despite its origins in Vedic ritual,
the geometry of the Śulbasūtra was the common
heritage of Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina
mathe-maticians alike. Varāhamihira in Ujjain
became thoroughly conversant with Āryabhaa’s
work in distant Kusumapura within about thirty
years. A thou-sand years later, the hold of
Aryabhatan ideas on the Nila mathematicians was
so strong that some historians refer to them as the
Āryabhaa school. One can cite any number of
other instances: the past was part of the living
present, at all times and everywhere. No Indian
mathematician had to redis-cover the work of
pūrvācāryas as Europe had to rediscover the
achievements of the Hellenic civilisation before
laying claim to its intellectual inheritance.
3. ORALITY AND ITS LEGACY: THE GRAMMAR
OF NUMBERS
Going through an Indian mathematical text
is a disorienting experience for a modern reader
who has not been exposed to one earlier. It is all
words, with no symbols and no equations; even
the numbers are spelt out in words, as their literal
names or linguistic substitutes for them.2 This is
as true of works composed in cryptic sūtras as in
more expansive verse or even more dilatory prose.
We believe we know how the trend started: one
cannot have a symbolic notation without writing
and the scholarly consensus is that the Vedic
culture was an oral, verbal culture which did not
have writing or at least had no use for it when it
2 There are also very few diagrams in the manuscripts, generally written down fairly late, but that is probably because of the
difficulty of drawing reasonably precise figures on palm leaf with a metal stylus. There is good evidenc that figures formed part
of doing and teaching geometry.62
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
came to the sacred; and the sahitā texts, as much
as the instructions for the making of vedis – and,
hence, geometry itself – were sacred. That the very
early mathematics was expressed non-
symboloically is then not a surprise; the surprise
is that the spurning of the symbolic and the written
survived the arrival of writing – using, it may be
added, a systematically organised, abstract and
very symbolic syllabary. Perhaps the responsibility
lay with the very conservatism that ensured
mathematical continuity. The fact is that the
reliance on the oral had enormous consequences,
not only in the communication of mathematics but
also in its exposition and in the way it was thought
about.3
To begin at the beginning, the greatest
influence of orality, mathematically, was on the
genesis and evolution of a system for counting,
that most fundamental of all mathematical skills.
Numeracy, especially in its symbolic form, is now
such a routine accomplishment that we barely
pause to wonder at the sophistication of the
principles that make the act of counting – and
everything else that depends on it including much
of mathematics – possible at all. At its root lies
the idea of a base, 10 in India, but in principle any
other – the 60 of the Babylonians for example –
will do as well. Staying with the familiar decimal
base, the role of 10 in apprehending precisely a
large number is similar to that of say a unit of
length, the meter, in measuring an otherwise
unknown length. The basic arithmetical operation
that applies to such measurements is division with
remainder. Thus, take a number and divide it by
10, say 1947 = 194 x 10 + 7 and repeat the
operation until the quotient becomes less than 10:
1947 = 194 x 10 + 7 = (19 x 10 + 4) x 10 + 7 and
so on, resulting finally in 1 x 103 + 9 x 102 + 4 x
101 + 7 x 100. The problem of the cognition of any
number whatsoever is thereby reduced to that of
numbers less than 10 that are the coefficients of
powers of 10 which I will call, following
Bharthari (see below), atomic numbers. The key
to the written representation of a number is in the
realisation that these coefficients, specified in
order, define the number uniquely; thus the
sequence (1, 9, 4, 7), ordered to the right in
decreasing powers of 10 and abbreviated to 1947,
is shorthand for a polynomial when the variable
is fixed at 10 (the coefficients are necessarily less
than 10). The rules of arithmetical operations are
all reflections of corresponding algebraic rules for
polynomials though historically, of course, it
happened the other way, from numbers and
arithmetic to algebra.
The description above of the mathematics
of enumeration is tailored to a written symbolic
representation of numbers. The only extra
ingredient it needs to be completely unambiguous
is a symbol to mark an empty place, in other words
a zero symbol as in 409 or 490. What can one do
to carry out the same construction of numbers
when one has no writing? The Indian answer is
that one gives them spoken names. Begin with
names for the atomic numbers, arbitrary but
unanimously agreed, eka, dvi, . . ., nava, just like
the arbitrary symbols 1, 2, . . ., 9. Then one assigns
names to the places, the positions corresponding
to the ordered powers of 10, also in principle
arbitrary (although they may have – and some do
– other meanings than numerical): daśa, śata, etc.
Finally one combines these two sets of names to
arrive at an ideal naming system for every number
however large, inventing new names for higher
and higher powers of 10 as the need is felt. But
we are now dealing not with an abstract
convention but a living language, Vedic Sanskrit,
and the language has a grammar, and the grammar
3 There is a partially preserved text, the Bakhshali Manuscript, that has a fair amount of symbolic notation and it is the only such.
It is a singular document in other ways as well, not easy to fit into the standard chronology (4th or 5th century AD in my view).
At least some mathematicians probably employed symbolic notation ‘behind the scenes’. If they did, they kept it out of their
formal writing, and it is difficult to know how widespread the custom was and whether there was anything like a uniform
notational convention.WHAT IS INDIAN ABOUT INDIAN MATHEMATICS?

has rules for combining words so as to create other
words with a specific, grammatically determined,
meaning. Forming number names is a small part
of the function of such general rules of nominal
composition but they may not be violated. They
must also have the universality and precision that
mathematics demands: universal meaning that the
rules should be categorical, not depending on the
individual numbers being combined, and precise
in the sense of the result being a uniquely
identifiable number, conditions that are not
indispensable in general linguistic usage.
There is no manual devoted to the science
of numbers in the Vedic literature, perhaps
because, unlike geometry, decimal counting and
its evolution were organically part of the
systematisation of Vedic grammar itself. In fact
even the mathematical texts, over the centuries,
pay little attention to the subject but for the
numerous listings of the names of powers of 10.
(A partial exception is the last great masterpiece
of Indian mathematics (in Malayalam prose),
Yuktibhāā of Jyehadeva (ca. 1525)). The
absence of a theoretical tract is more than made
up for, fortunately, by the abundance of numbers
in several Vedic texts, with the gveda at the head,
of which many are compound numbers – those
which are neither atomic nor powers of 10 –
requiring the application of the rules of nominal
composition in the formation and analysis of their
names. For an appreciation of the the kind of
analysis the decryption of a compound number
name calls for, it helps to keep two facts in mind,
one primarily mathematical and the other
grammatical. Firstly, there are only two operations
involved in making a polynomial, multiplication
and addition (in logical order), which are to be
encoded into the grammar of number names: thus
409 = 4 × 100 + 9. Grammatically, addition is
conjunction and though there are several samāsas
by which it is implemented, they are easy to spot.
Secondly, short of saying that every other other
kind of composition represents multiplication, an
independent 
grammatical 
analysis 
of
multiplicative composition is more involved. The
key here is that most numbers function as
adjectives, so many cows for example; in ‘four
hundred cows’, ‘four hundred’ is an adjective and
‘four’ is an adverb qualifying the adjective
‘hundred’, signifying the 4-fold repetition of the
action of counting up to 100. The rules for the
formation of such repetetive numerical adverbs
in the gveda can be extracted and they are
basically the same as codified by Pāini much later
– allowance being made for some chandasi
exceptions – as are the rules for their declensions
via various affixes. With two or three irresoluble
exceptions, every number name yields a unique
number when Pāini is supplemented by an
occasional appeal to the older authority of the
word-for-word reading, the padapāha.4
The evidence of the gveda is doubly
important in tracing the antiquity of decimal
enumeration because there has always been a
subconscious tendency, natural in view of the
ubiquity of writing, to confuse the abstract
principle with its symbolic manifestation. As far
as the principle is concerned, the symbolic and
the nominal are just equivalent representations of
an abstract structure.
4. ORALITY AND ITS LEGACY: BEYOND
COUNTING
The symbiosis between numbers and
grammar touches only one – undeniably the most
important – facet of how orality impacted
mathematics (as it did many other fields of
4 But the analysis is not always trivial. In the 19th century, before H. Kern’s first published edition of the work came out in 1874,
the Āryabhaīya was known to Western scholars only by name as Āryāaśata (for the 108 verses in its three substantive chap-
ters), which is how Brahmagupta referred to it. H. T. Colebrooke, the first translator of Brahmagupta, and E, Burgess, ditto of the
Sūryasiddhānta, both read aśata as 800, a mistake they would not have made had they paid attention to how repetitive adverbs
(āvtti-vācaka) are to be formed.64
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
activity). A receptive ear can hear its echoes
resonating through the centuries, all the way down
to the last significant mathematical writings of
16th century Kerala. Let us turn now to a brief
and highly selective recapitulation of some of
these aspects.
The most striking at first sight (one should
perhaps say at first hearing), is mathematical
language. With a few exceptions, texts were
composed in (Sanskrit) verse, the earlier ones,
including the Āryabhaīya, in an almost
impenetrably dense sūtra format. Orality puts a
premium on memory. In the absence of written
texts, knowledge exists only in the memories of
those who possess it and the resort to metrical
verse, like the extreme concision, was an essential
aid to memorisation. Versification in its turn
brought up interesting and difficult mathematical
questions and it took a long time for them to be
precisely formulated and resolved, by Piñgala in
his Chandasūtra (3rd or 2nd century BC?).
Deprived of writing, language is the articulation
of sounds and phonetic accuracy is the guarantor
of its integrity. The regularity of organisation of
the Sanskrit syllabary, already clearly evident in
the earliest Vedic texts, but given its final form at
about the time of Pāini, is part of the response of
the linguistsages to the challenge of preserving
textual purity. Given that every syllable falls into
one of two subsets depending on the duration of
its articulation, the sequencing of syllables in a
line of verse will determine a quasi-musical pattern
(aided in Vedic recitation by the accents, which
disappeared from later, classical, Sanskrit,
probably with the arrival of writing) which is what
a metre is. Piñgala characterised all such patterns
for any syllabic length, thereby shutting the field
down for good and, in the process, initiating the
discipline of combinatorial mathematics. It is an
astonishing piece of work; nothing like it existed
in any other civilisation and we can see why: it
needs a phonologically structured syllabary such
as that of Sanskrit for a mathematical study of
prosody, the science of chandas, to be at all
feasible. The other remark is that Piñgala’s formal
methodology owes something to Pāini – that is
not surprising; he was likely a near contemporary
of Pata–jali – particularly in the use of
metamathematical/metalinguistic labels to
designate subsets of objects sharing a common
mathematical property or following a common
linguistic rule. The curious fact is that Indian
mathematicians seem to have paid him little
attention until quite late and never to have made
use of the notion of a set.
Piñgala comes into the picture in another
role which has nothing directly to do with
combinatorics but ties up with orality in a different
way. He was the first to refer to the zero, śūnya,
as a mathematically defined object, a number like
any other. The idea of nothing, an emptiness, a
vacancy, has been a subject of endless fascination
to Indian learned men past and present, from
grammarians to philosophers, going back to Pāini
and his much-cited aphorism, adarśanalopa,
“that which is not present is lopa”. The story of
the mathematical śūnya is more mundane. The
gveda does not have it nor does any other text
before the Chandasūtra. And it occurs there in a
context which makes its strictly numerical
connotation absolutely clear: it is paired with dvi
as a metamathematical marker, names of subsets
occurring in a particular metre-classification
problem.
The reason for the late appearance of zero
as a number, a thousand years after the gveda
and its profusion of numbers, is not difficult to
see: an oral, nominal system of enumeration does
not need it, unlike a written, symbolic system
which, as we saw, cannot do without it; there are
natural linguistic alternatives like ‘there is no cow’
to the unnatural ‘there is zero cow’. Nor does
arithmetic require its use. To multiply 409 and 51
for example, it is enough to say: (4 hundreds and
9 ones) times (5 tens and 1 one) is (4 times 5)
thousands and (4 times 1) hundreds and (9 timesWHAT IS INDIAN ABOUT INDIAN MATHEMATICS?
65
5) tens and (9 times 1) ones and go on from there,
resulting in the answer (2 ten thousands and 8
hundreds and 5 tens and 9 ones) (= 20859 in
symbols), with not a śūnya in sight.5
More puzzling is the absence of a symbolic
zero after writing became widespread. The earliest
known examples of writing in India, the edicts of
Aśoka, have numbers in them but no zero. It is
puzzling because Aśoka and Piñgala lived within
maybe a century of each other. Even more
mystifyingly, there is no zero in any of the many
inscriptions from the following several centuries,
on stone and coin, generally in Brāhmi characters,
though they have lots of numbers. We have already
referred to the fact that the first known, dated,
symbolic zeros are from 7th century southeast
Asia. Even if the zero in the shape of a dot
(śūnyabindu) in the Bakhshali manuscript is
earlier, perhaps as early as the 4th century, that
still leaves a gap of about seven hundred years
between Piñgala’s mathematical zero (and the
advent of writing) and its first written
manifestation. What can account for this long
delay in the passage from abstract idea to concrete
symbol of a concept which, for many, is the very
essence of the (decimal) place-value system?
Part of the answer is that it is no such thing;
people could manage very well without it, and did,
for a long time. The clue to the mystery of the
missing zero really lies in that fact. The written
Brāhmi number system went through a phase of
experimentation before acquiring some sort of
regularity, say by about the 2nd century AD (in
the inscriptions of Nasik for example). It had
symbols for the atomic numerals as well as
individual single symbols for 10, 100 and 1000
(no zeros there), and these were combined to form
multiples of powers of 10 by attaching atomic
numerals as suffixes to the powers of 10: it is as
though we were to choose to write 300 and 400 as
1003 and 1004 (remember that 100 itself was a
single symbol). The additive part of the
polynomial algorithm is then implemented by
writing the terms to be added side by side, like
10049 for 409. We can recognise this strange
system, symbolic but not positional, for what it is
right away. It is none else than a faithful rendering
into symbols of the names of atomic and power-
of-10 numbers, and also of the grammatical rules
that bind them together, from the pre-existing
verbal nomenclature; suffixing and juxtaposition
are, symbolically, multiplicative and additive
composition respectively. And, naturally, there is
no 0 because it is not needed. Brāhmi numbers
are visual symbols not for the numbers themselves
but for their grammatically determined names;
they really are a testimony to the absolute primacy
of the spoken language.
We have no idea when written numbers
finally freed themselves from the tyranny of orality
and became fully positional. Aside from the
undated Bakhshali manuscript, the first dated
written positional numbers are from the end of
the 6th century. They do not have a zero but that
is probably a matter of chance and, in any case,
less important in the grand scheme of the evolution
of numeration than that they are truly positional.
It is this scheme that then travelled to Persia and
the Abbasid kingdom and eventually to Europe.
The pervasive influence of language and
the resistance to symbolic notation had other
consequences such as the premium put on the
precision of technical terminology. The fact that
Sanskrit is a language that values syntactical rigour
above all meant that technical terms, very long
when necessary, could be manufactured with a
high degree of specificity, mitigating to a limited
extent the disadvantages of a narrative style of
doing mathematics. But, without a matching
degree of linguistic (and mathematical) sensitivity
5This is trivial but it had to be said. What it reflects is the fact that no 0 is required in the usual way of writing polynomials nor in
algebraic operations with them; a term with coefficient 0 is just absent, lopa in the Pāinian sense. The 0 symbol is the price to
be paid for abbreviating the full polynomial as it is normally written to the sequence of its coefficients as in a written number.66
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
on the part of the auditor or reader, it could also
lead to misunderstanding and error. Examples of
how the original exactitude of nomenclature was
lost in sloppy readings are easy to find but let us
restrict to one, historically significant, which has
only recently been cleared up. Of the major
achievements on which Brahmagupta’s greatness
rests, one is the creation of an elaborate theory of
cyclic quadrilaterals, four-sided figures whose four
corners lie on a circle. It is a remarkable body of
work which took its inspiration from the
Śulbasūtra and the diagonal theorem (the
continuity mentioned earlier) and carried it to a
spectacular conclusion. But the mathematics is not
the issue here. Brahmagupta invented the term
tricaturbhuja for the object of his interest and it
caused much confusion among later scholars
including some famous traditional commentators
(presumably not descended from him through a
line of oral transmission) – what could a 3-sided
4-sided figure be? – who chose to interpret it as a
conjunctive compound: a trilateral and a
quadrilateral, a reading not supported by either
mathematics or grammar. The confusion
disappears once it is realised that Brahmagupta’s
theory of the cyclic quadrilateral is built on an
imaginative and powerful exploitation of one key
property: while it has four sides, only three can
be assigned independent lengths, the fourth then
being fixed; a cyclic quadrilateral really is a
triquadrilateral in this sense. Grammar vindicates
this reading.6
5 GEOMETRY
When it comes to geometry, we are all
Euclideans. Euclid defines geometry for us as the
decimal system defines numbers, we know no
other kind. It bears recalling why. First comes
admiration for the magnificent edifice he erected,
proposition built upon proposition, easy or
difficult, and then the realisation of the deeper
truth, that all of it, even theorems as far removed
from being self-evident as can be – think of the
nine-point circle – follows relentlessly from a
handful of apparently self-evident postulates, with
an equally self-evident set of rules of reasoning
as guiding principles. The Elements was the first,
and for a very long time the only, mathematical
work in which every result emerged out of the
inexorable logic of deductive reasoning, without
room for ambiguity or doubt, the perfect example
of a deductive system of knowledge.
For anyone brought up in this world of
mathematical certitude (in both senses), the first
encounter with the geometry practised in India,
from the Śulbasūtra onwards, can be
disconcerting. There are no lists of postulates, in
fact there are no postulates. Their role is taken
over by (unspecified) notions on which everyone
(presumably) agreed – a common store of
knowledge – such as: two lines each perpendicular
to a given line will not intersect. Definitions are
implicit in the constructions, not spelled out;
nowhere does one find a circle, drawn with a pair
of cord-compasses, defined as the locus of points
at a constant distance from a fixed point. Educated
common sense takes the place of Euclid’s
“common notions”. Altogether, rather than the
strictly segregated categories of unquestionable
assumptions Euclid needed to get going, we find
a more fluid foundation of intelligent good sense,
unquestioned at a given time but not
unquestionable.
Indian geometry is much more visual than
that of Euclid, in the sense that diagrams convey
a good idea of the geometric truth behind them
(as some of the figures below illustrate), rather
than just serve as props in the logical
argumentation. The reason probably is that it has
generally stayed in touch with the real world: it
began in the architecture, streetscapes and
decorative plastic arts of the Indus Valley – an
6 There is a verse in the Āryabhaīya which refers to trilaterals and quadrilaterals together. The term employed is the conjunctively
correct tribhujāccaturbhujā.WHAT IS INDIAN ABOUT INDIAN MATHEMATICS?
67
area whose study is still in its infancy – and it
retained its architectural bias in Vedic times before
becoming the mathematical vehicle of astronomy
with Āryabhaa. The basic building block is the
circle, easy to draw with the cord-compass, two
sticks and a length of cord stretched taut between
them. Circles lead naturally to pairs of mutually
perpendicular lines in several different ways. The
one that found favour in India, already in the Indus
artefacts and right through till the end, arises as
follows: when two circles intersect, the line
conneting the two points of intersection, the
common chord, is perpendicular to the line joining
the centres; if the circles are of equal radii, the
two lines are, in addition, divided equally by their
point of intersection. There is a method for
constructing a square with the cord-compass at
the beginning of the earliest Śulbasūtra, that of
Baudhāyana, which uses nothing but this property
(which I will call the Indian orthogonality
property). Rather than reproduce Baudhāyana’s
instructions for drawing it (see Fig. 1), I will let
the reader’s eye wander over the various circles
and the lines joining their intersections, take in its
visual appeal and then let the geometric truth
emerge. (For the unconvinced, it is an instructive
exercise to prove, starting from Euclid’s axioms,
that ABCD is in fact a square).
The construction is (or should be)
something of a pivotal point in any enquiry into
the Indianness of Indian geometry. Historically,
sequences of intersecting circles generating
pleasing patterns, of which the square in Fig. 1
represents the ‘unit cell’, occur in quite a few Indus
Valley artefacts. The similarity is so uncanny that
it is not possible to doubt that Indian orthogonality
represents a direct line of continuity between Indus
and Vedic cultures, one of the very very few such
tangibles that we have. It is also quite unGreek.
In Euclid’s austerely deductive geometry, the
circle comes late – its first appearance is in Book
III – well after what for him are the elementary
building blocks, lines, and the constructs that
follow immediately, their intersections, angles
between them, figures composed of them,
especially triangles (including the Pythagorean
property of right triangles). The most fundamental
relationship between a pair of lines is
perpendicularity in India, not parallelism as for
Euclid, so much so that the term tribhujā always
meant a right triangle rather than a general one.
One can cite many such oppositions. Taken
together, they are a good reason to be cautious
when questions of mutual influences come up as
they have, repeatedly, over more than a century.
Mathematically, the prime significance of
the ‘square from circles’ construction is that the
diagonal theorem and diagonal triples play no part
in it. Indeed, there is no sign of the Pythagorean
paradigm in any of the (admittedly few) places
we might expect to find it among Harappan
remains, including in the perpendicular street
grids; Indian orthogonality is enough. In the
Śulbasūtra, on the other hand, it is omnipresent.
Where did it come from – indigenously discovered
or through contact with the intervening
Mesopotamian civilisation? We will return to this
question in section 9 below but, for the present,
only note that we have good reasons to believe
that the Vedic sages knew the diagonal theorem
to be a theorem; it was not guesswork, they had
proofs.
Before that, let us turn briefly to another,
simpler, construction from the Śulbasūtra which
also has a link with the Indus civilisation as well
Fig. 1. Square from circles (no diagonal theorem).68
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
as with an equally far off future development,
namely Āryabhaa’s trigonometry. It is a method
(the only one documented in India) for
determining the prācī, the true east independent
of location and season, by means of the shadow
of a vertical rod: fix the rod at the centre of a circle
and mark the two points at which the tip of its
shadow touches the circle (W and E in Fig. 2)
during the course of a day; then WE points to the
east.
and the diagonal theorem. The direction east
retained its special role as the axis of reference
even after geometry lost its sacral moorings, in
the choice of celestial coordinates in astronomy
as well as in pure geometry where it became the
equivalent of the modern positive y-axis. More
generally, from a cultural perspective, geometry
seems to have undergone two contextual
transformations: from secular (Indus Valley, as far
as we can tell; so very little is known about its
ritual practices) to sacred (Śulbasūtra; perhaps an
example of the bestowing of magical powers on
newly discovered knowledge) and back to secular.
That each step in the evolution took such a long
time, we might also say, is just another signature
of Indianness.
The Śulbasūtra of course have no proofs.
As far as the diagonal theorem is concerned, a
collection of them have been supplied over the
centuries by various commentators. The simplest
are direct and visual, based on cutting up the
relevant areas appropriately and refitting the pieces
differently; in Euclid’s language, the notion
involved is congruence of the pieces. Their
credibility as representing Śulbasūtra thinking
derives from several factors taken together, each
of which may not be definitive. Firstly, the
statement of the geometric theorem in the
Śulbasūtra is strictly geometric, without reference
to numbers or computation. Number-free, cut-and-
fit geometry of areas is characteristic of many
constructions in the Śulbasūtra, some of which
are the same as the suggested proofs, especially
in the case of the square. Furthermore, long after
geometry had transcended visual reasoning, we
still find cut-and-fit proofs, only for the diagonal
theorem, as late as in the writings of Nīlakaha
and Jyehadeva. The robustness of the
transmission chain is a persuasive guarantee that
a commentator of say the 11th century who
ascribes his particular reading of a proposition to
Baudhāyana or Āpastamba is likely to be repeating
a line of argument that goes back a long way,
maybe even all the way to them.
Fig. 2. Determination of the prācī.
The plausible continuity of geometric
themes of which we have already seen an example
argues for this simple method as having originated
in the cardinal orientation of streets and buildings
in the Indus Valley cities. The connection with the
trigonometry of the future is equally unmissable:
it is impossible to look at the figure without seeing
at once that the north-south line – also needed by
the ritualists – cuts the chord EW perpendicularly
into two equal halves (Indian orthogonality,
effectively), each of which is the half-chord
(jyārdha) or the sine. All of trigonometry is
encapsulated in this diagram and in the diagonal
theorem applied to the right triangle of which the
half-chord is one side. The half-chord as a concept
does not occur in Greek geometry. We might say
that trigonometry as a discipline has its distant
origin in the needs of ritual architects; it is very
Indian in the way it is rooted in practical needs, is
easily visualisable and brings together two of the
signature elements of Indian geometry, the circleWHAT IS INDIAN ABOUT INDIAN MATHEMATICS?
69
For the square, the traditional proofs are
so elementary that Nīlakaha considered the
theorem to be self-evident. Fig. 3 shows two
variants. (The lengths of the side and the diagonal
are denoted by a and d respectively, merely for
the purpose of identification).
triangle) and gone on from there. It is not
impossible that the theorem reached him in its
general form, the very easy special case having
got mislaid somewhere, some time.
The final big advance in geometry was
Mādhava’s marriage of two themes from the past,
trigonometry and the idea of infinity, to create the
new discipline that, much later and in an alien
culture, came to be named calculus. We will catch
a glimpse of what is Indian in it in a later section
but, like Brahmagupta’s work, proper justice
cannot be done to it in a general review.
6 WHAT IS A PROOF?
Very few of the texts setting out original
results for the first time bother to give even an
indication of how they were obtained; the
Śulbasūtra are only the first illustration of this
tendency. Commentaries are a little better; they
explain difficult points, add their own
interpretations and so on but, with rare exceptions,
will disappoint those looking for sharply
enunciated and logically laid out demonstrations.
Even in the great masterpieces, terminology is
often not properly defined, conditions that apply
not explicitly stated (Āryabhaa, Brahmagupta, ...).
This gave rise to a widely shared belief that the
masters did not have communicable proofs for the
results they discovered and in the theories they
created or, worse, did not have universally agreed
criteria for what a proof should be. Modern
scholarship has begun to undo this
misunderstanding, mainly by recognising that the
real purpose of the canonical texts was to leave a
permanent record of knowledge newly gathered,
not to justify it; that was done in the parallel
pedagogic activity of face-to-face in-struction. In
the time-honoured Indian tradition of discussion
and debate (orality again), the ideal way of
learning was to have the master or someone of his
intellectaul progeny explain and clarify and
respond to questions, like Bhaspati with Indra
(see the next section).
In the first variant for example, the square
on the diagonal, suitably drawn (the outer square),
is cut into eight congruent (isosceles) right
triangles, four of which fit together to form the
square on a side (the inner square), and that is all
of the proof. For the rectangle, the simplest proofs
are based on the same area-matching idea (there
is quite a collection of them) but a degree of
geometric imagination is also demanded. It seems
likely that the theorem was first formulated for
the square and then generalised; Baudhāyana’s
presentation is in that order. The strategy of first
dealing with the simplest special case and then
stretching it as far as it will go is very typical,
though it is not always as straightforward as it is
here; Brahmagupta’s theory of cyclic
quadrilaterals is a good illustration of how
powerful and technically subtle it could become.
It is easy to make these visual proofs
conform to Euclidean axiomatism; a good
definition of the square and the notion of congruent
right triangles will do the trick. One can wonder
if Euclid might have devised an equally trivial
proof if he had had the idea of first looking at the
square (which is not the same as the isosceles right
Fig. 3. The diagonal theorem for the square70

But even if we ignored this primary mode
of knowledge transmission, it would be naive to
imagine that mathematical knowledge – the best
of it far from being “self-evident to the intelligent”
– came out of informed guesswork or
computational astuteness alone (supplemented
perhaps by divine revelation?).7 It is a telling fact
that in India’s vast mathematical inheritance, there
are very very few results (and none that is genuinly
deep and original) which are plainly wrong, two
errors (on volumes of solids) by Āryabhaa (of all
people) being the most notorious. For mere
conjectures, this is an impossibly high rate of
success as we know in the context of modern
mathematics. Equally naive is to suppose that there
was no idea of what a proof should aim to be.
Mathematicians were not given to bringing logic
or philosophy into their writings – they barely
managed to get all their mathematics in – but it
would be absurd to think that they were ignorant
of or untouched by the spirited disputes and fine
hair-splittings of the various schools of philos-
ophy/logic, a great deal of it about the
fundamentally epistemic question of how we know
something to be true. Indeed, the one
mathematician who did write about foundational
issues, Nīlakaha, shows himself to be very well
informed on such matters. It is time to lay to rest
the misconception that the best of gems from the
ocean of true and false knowledge were brought
up by any agency other than the exercise of
individual intelligence, svamati.
Āryabhaa has given us exactly one short
verse about where good mathematics comes from;
fortunately, his most perceptive interpreter,
Nīlakaha, has much more to say about how we
acquire knowledge and about how we are to know
it to be true. There is a background. Nīlakaha
was an exceptionally good mathematical
astronomer and his guru’s guru, Parameśvara, an
equally good observational astronomer who
revised the basic parameters governing planetary
motions, inherited ultimately from Āryabhaa, on
the ground that they no longer accounted for his
observations. In three books written at the end of
a long life championing his grand-guru’s work (in
an already full and fulfilling life), Nīlakaha
expresses himself freely on the enterprise of
acquiring and validating knowledge. The primary
instrumentality is that of our senses, even in
mathematics (it must be remembered that he was
partial to almost tactile, geometric, reasoning in
arithmetical and algebraic problems, by 2- and 3-
dimensional cut-and-fit methods). The ‘raw data’
are to be subjected to analysis and (tentative)
inferences drawn by means of our mental faculties,
to be then exposed to criticism by the
knowledgeable and taught to young students. If
the conclusions are at odds with the revelations
of sacred books (śruti) or the word of mortals
however influential (smti), the śruti-smti twins
are to be rejected. (It must also be remembered
that, as far as a rational world-view is concerned,
the thousand years after Āryabhaa was a period
of regressive Purāic ascendancy. A 9th century
astronomical text by one of his followers makes
fun of paurā ika-śruti on the subject of eclipses;
this battle is an old one).
Nīlakaha is critical of pure theory as,
according to him, theories are endless and
inconclusive. There is no room in his inductive
world view for any sort of axiomatism as indeed
there was not in Indian philosophical systems from
the time of the Buddha and the śrāmaa
movements; no first causes and first principles,
no unquestionable “postulates” and “common
notions”. And no strictly deductive proofs: if all
knowledge is contingent, how can it be otherwise
for metaknowledge, the knowledge that something
(anything) is or is not true? The principles of plane
7 The last but one stanza of the Āryabhaīya says: “From the ocean of true and false knowledge, by the grace of brahman, the best
of gems that is true knowledge has been brought up by me, by the boat of my own intelligence” (my emphasis; the Sanskrit word
is svamati). It must be added that, grammatically, this brahman is to be taken as the immanent spirit of the cosmos (neuter in
gender), not the male god of creation, Brahmā with a capital B.WHAT IS INDIAN ABOUT INDIAN MATHEMATICS?
71
geometry and the rules of arithmetic are
trustworthy not because they derive from the
axioms of Euclid and of Peano (far into the future)
but because they work.
Nīlakaha practised what he preached.
Especially in the bhāya of the Gaita chapter of
the Āryabhaīya, his proofs of Āryabhaa’s
propositions are models of clarity and logical
completeness. As though in acknowledgement of
these newly advertised virtues, the word yukti for
proof (‘reasoned justification’ in the context)
began to displace the older term upapatti in
writings from Kerala. The significance of this shift
of emphasis in the organisation of proofs can be
gauged from the title, Yuktibhāā, of the
masterpiece written by his disciple Jyehadeva,
ostensibly as a mathematical guide to his
astronomy but much more than that in reality: a
textbook covering the high points of the
mathematics of the day, complete with detailed
proofs of all propositions.
The question of what constitutes a proof
outside a strictly axiomatic-deductive framework
has been a subject of intense debate over the last
century or so. Without speculating about
Nīlakaha’s credentials as an early intuitionist (it
has been suggested), it seems safe to say that the
Indian position in its maturity would have been
that it is a futile quest, endless and inconclusive.
As a matter of vyavahāra, practical considerations,
most mathematicians would have been happy to
leave the verdict on whether they had proved
something or not ultimately to the judgement of
their peers. Bhāskara II says at one place that a
piece of mathematics whose upapatti does not
meet with the approval of the learned assembly is
like rice without butter; the simile is interesting
in that he implies only that it is unpalatable.
Nīlakaha does not refer to the one
epistemic given that apparently had universal
acceptance among Indian mathematicians, which
is the rejection of the principle of the excluded
middle. The stance had major consequences, chief
among them the repudiation of the powerful proof
device of reductio ad absurdum, reduction to
absurdity, proof by contradiction. In the axiomatic
philosophy, to exclude the middle is to assert that
logic is bivalent: a proposition is either true or
not true (or, synonymously, false; it is good to be
pedantic because the issue is not free from
linguistic ambiguity). To prove that a proposition
is true, one starts by supposing that it is false and
shows that the axiom system (and the rules of
logic) within which the proposition is framed
necessarily leads to a contradiction which, by
bivalence, means that the proposition is true: a
proposition and its negation cannot both be false.
Among the earliest and simplest examples of its
use is Euclid’s (or perhaps someone else’s) proof
that the square root of 2 is not a rational number,
i.e., that it cannot be expressesd as a fraction. The
proof consists in showing that assuming that it is
a fraction (the negation of the proposition to be
proved) leads to a contradiction with a property
of fractions which says that they can always be
simplified by removing common factors from the
numerator and denominator. Now √2 is a ‘number’
the Śulbasūtra authors were familiar with
geometrically as the diagonal of the unit square
(which is also how the Greeks knew it) and
Baudhāyana gives a value for it as a fraction,
making it clear that it is not exact. The step to the
realisation that no fraction can be the exact value
of √2 was not taken until the very end when
Nīlakaha declares (very uncharacteristically,
with no yukti) that it cannot be determined.
The notion of irrationality appears
straightforward when formulated negatively (not
a fraction) but a satisfactory positive definition
(what is it then?) is subtle and was not even
attempted till the 19th century. Correspondingly,
all reasonably elementary proofs of irrationality
are by contradiction; it is in fact not easy to see
that even the sophisticated, more structurally
formulated, proofs are fully free from the taint of72
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
reductio at all levels of their total architecture. In
any case, one can easily understand that a culture
which refused to exclude the middle would have
had serious reservations about such proofs. Indian
scepticism about the philosophical utility of logical
bivalence goes far back, at least to the Buddha’s
reluctance to categorise what is and what is not,
well before Nāgārjuna formalised tetravalence:
that {yes, no, yes-and-no, neither-yes-nor-no}
exhaust all logical possibilities.
Bivalence requires (as indeed does
tetravalence) an unambiguous logical meaning to
be attached to linguistic negation: what does ‘not’
mean? Formally, to be able to usefully identify a
set S′ not having a particular property, one must
have a universal set U which circumscribes all the
possibilities one is willing to consider and of which
the set S which has the property is a sub-set; S′ is
the complement of S in U. In the irrationality
problem U is taken (tacitly in the early days, more
consciously nowadays) to be the set of all real
numbers, numbers which are the lengths of all
(geometric) straight lines (never mind how that is
defined). To see why the universe cannot be
dispensed with, we only have to note that all the
arithmetical steps of Euclid’s proof remain
unchanged if we ask whether √-2 can be expressed
as a fraction (once we extend numbers to include
negatives). It cannot be, but it is not a real number
either as we know. Indeed, one Indian
mathematician, very late, claimed that square roots
of negative numbers cannot exist since the square
of every number is positive. (The faint reflection
of bivalence that is seen here had the sanction of
some schools of logic but only in non-existence
proofs). The Buddha’s discourses did not, of
course, specify a universe of propositions,
encompassing as they did questions of life and
death, of cosmogony, metaphysics, ethics, etc.
Within such a wide and ill-defined horizon, it is
not obvious how to define negation in a formally
acceptable way.
The high point of Nīlakaha’s
engagement with irrationals is a remark-able
passage in his bhāya of the Āryabhaīya claiming
that the value of π (defined as the ratio of the
circumference of a circle to its diameter) can only
be given approximately because there is no single
unit of length that will measure both the
circumference and the diameter without a
remainder in at least one of them, in other words
that π cannot be a fraction. How did he know?
Once again, he does not say. My wishful
hypothesis is that he had some kind of a proof by
contradiction – technically it would have been
within his reach since the main tool in many
elementary proofs, the theory of continued
fractions, was part of the equipment of the Nila
school – which he kept to himself because it would
not have passed the test of philosophical approval.
A final comment on the subject of method.
Just as conspicuous as the absence of reductio is
the ubiquity of a style of reasoning that can be
called, in very general terms, recursive. A recursive
process is, loosely, one which results from the
iteration of an elementary process in which the
output of the nth step in the iteration is fed back
as the input of the (n + 1)th step.8 In this generality,
the idea is of wide applicability. Frits Staal in
particular has written extensively about the
presence of recursive patterns in the syntactic
structure of rituals, in the chants which accompany
them, and in grammatical constructions of various
sorts: padapāha and prātiśākhya in their role as
aids to memory (orality again) and, most
effectively, in the possibility of the repeated
application of nominal composition, potentially
without end. That alone makes it an essential
component of the Indianness of Indian
mathematics. Its mathematical avatars can,
naturally, be highly technical and we will have to
be content with a selective and qualitative
overview.
8 Logicians and computer theorists work with more precise definitions. The subject is of much current interest partly because
recursive algorithms are economical and effective in computation: maximal precision from minimal lines of code.WHAT IS INDIAN ABOUT INDIAN MATHEMATICS?
73
The prototype recursive structure is the one
that defines that primordial object, the set of all
decimal (more generally, place-value or based)
numbers. The elementary process is division with
remainder. As we saw in section 3, the decimal
entry in the place of ones of a number N is obtained
as the remainder n1 when N is divided by 10: N =
10N1+n1; n2 in the place of tens as the remainder
when the quotient N1 is divided by 10: N1 = 10N2
+ n2; and so on. Having seen also that decimal
counting is as old as the earliest literary forms of
Vedic Sanskrit, we may well imagine that it might
have been the unacknowledged model for the
recursive elements in nonmathematical, in
particular linguistic, structures. And, as we shall
see in the next section, acknowledgement did
come eventually, from Bharthari.
Within the domain of mathematics itself,
the range of applications of the recursive idea is
amazingly diverse: definitions and constructions,
algorithms, expansions of functions as infinite
series, etc. – as is to be expected in India, the
dividing lines are not always very sharp – not to
mention its ultimate metamathematical
consummation as a method of proof, mathematical
induction. Depending on the problem, the
elementary process which will be iterated as well
as the initial input are matters of imagination and
choice. Apart from decimal counting itself, its
earliest use is as an algorithm for the square root
of a number which is not a square (a ‘number that
cannot be determined’) to arbitrary accuracy; there
is an explicit recursive formula for it in the
Bakhshali manuscript and it may well have been
used in deriving the Śulbasūtra approximation for
√2. Recursive logic runs through Āryabhaa’s
kuaka technique for the solution of the linear
indeterminate (Diophantine) equation as well as
Jayadeva’s solution (cakravāla) of Brah-
magupta’s quadratic analogue of it. But it is in the
work of the Nila school that the method finds its
full power and glory under the very appropriate
name of saskāram: every iterative step is a
refining of the approximate output of the previous
step for better accuracy and, carried ad infinitum,
leads to the exact answer ‘in the limit’. The general
technique of saskāram was as indispensable in
the implementation of Mādhava’s programme as
the infinitesimal philosophy was to its conception.
The details are intricate and, regrettably, we have
to leave it at that. As an inadequate substitute, here
is a quick look at how it works for the square root.
The starting point in all saskāram
computations is an educated, consciously
approximate, first guess at the answer. For the
square root of a number N, the first guess is the
square root of the square number that is closest to
N; for example, if N is 109, the first guess for its
square root is 10. The exact answer is 10 + x for
some unknown x; all we know is that (10 + x)2 =
100 + 20x + x2 = 109 and that x is less than 1 since
112 is greater than 109. The quadratic equation for
x can be approximately solved without taking
square roots by neglecting x2 in comparison with
100 + 20x. Thus 10 is the first input and the
elementary process is the easy solution of a linear
equation which, in the first step, is 100 + 20x =
109, giving x = 9/20. The input in the next iteration
is x = 10 + 9/20 and so on; the process is repeated
as many times as needed for a given requirement
of precision (it is actually a very efficient
algorithm). An alternative viewpoint is to think
of the square root as a function of N and carry out
the iteration indefinitely, arriving thereby at an
infinite series expansion of √N for any N.
7. NAMING AND KNOWING: THE PROBLEM OF
INFINITY
While language and grammar provided the
nourishing ambience in which mathematics
flourished, we must also note that the flow of ideas
was not all one way. The reductive power of the
decimal paradigm in making the unknowable
infinitude of numbers accessible through an
apprehension of a finite set of atomic numerals
had an appeal that went well beyond the purely74
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
mathematical, in particular to those who wrestled
with the unboundedness of language itself. The
concern about how to comprehend the infinite
potentiality of linguistic expressions through the
finite means at our command was already present
in very early writings on grammar; there is
Pata–jali’s fable about Bhaspati teaching
grammar to Indra by going over grammatical
expressions one by one and getting nowhere after
a thousand years of the gods, leading him to
conclude that they can be understood only by
means of some (finite number of) rules both
general and particular. General and particular rules
are precisely what go into the formation of
numbers. Several centuries later, in an act of
reciprocal generosity, decimal numbers –
inevitably, I would like to believe – became the
model for Bharthari (5th-6th century) for how
potentially unlimited structures in a language are
to be constructed from its elementary building
blocks. The perfectly named Vākyapadīya (“Of
Sentences and Words”) says: “Just as the grasping
of the first numbers is the means for the grasping
of other (or different) numbers, so it is with the
hearing of words”. (Note that words are heard).
The gloss, written by himself according to some
scholars, leaves no doubt about what he meant:
As the numbers beginning with one,
serving different purposes, are the means
of understanding numbers like hundred,
thousand, and so on, and are thought of
as constituent parts (avayava) of hundred
and so on, so the apprehension of a
sentence is based on the precise meaning
of words such as Devadatta, the
understanding of which is innate (or
inherent).9
Later on, he speaks of the atoms (au and
paramāu) of sound or speech (śabda) gathering
together, by their own capacity, like clouds: all
linguistic objects are formed by the agglomeration
of atoms of śabda, just as all numbers are formed
by the rule-bound coming together of atomic
numbers.
Bharthari was many things, linguist and
philosopher of language, epistemologist and
cognitive theorist, but a mathematician he was not.
Yet, the distinction he makes between the
cognition of the atomic numbers, ādya-sakhyā,
which is an innate capacity, and the compound
numbers formed by their clustering together is
accurate. The comprehension of these two classes
of numbers depends on quite distinct mental
processes. To know a compound number, we need
to apply the abstract arithmetical rules
underpinning the decimal system (the equivalent
of the ‘general rules’ of Pata–jali) no matter how
effortless it may appear in practice – that is what
the choice of a base such as 10 does. There cannot
be any rules for numbers less than the base and
that is why their cognition is an innate faculty –
and their names or symbols entirely arbitrary.
Concerns about how we ‘know’ a number
are very much older than Pata–jali, going as far
back as the genesis of the decimal system itself.
There is a line in a hymn to Agni from the early
Book IV of the gveda which equates the act of
counting to that of seeing and attributes the
capacity to do so to Agni, god of fire and light.
Louis Renou who first made the connection (later
taken up by Frits Staal) notes that khyā from which
sakhyāis derived is the verb root for seeing or
looking. Support for this identification comes from
Vedic words, still current, formed by attaching
prefixes other than sa to khyā all of which have
meanings derivable from illumination and/or
vision (examples: ākhyā, prakhyā, vikhyā, etc.).
And there are numerous passages in the gveda
that speak of Agni’s faculty of “comprehending
all things in this world minutely and correctly”,
arising out of his power to illumine. Numeracy
was a divine gift as language itself was; I like to
9 For mathematicians, the change in the value of the same numeral as a function of its position was of course not news. Neverthe-
less, the sense of novelty never seems to have worn off. Yuktibhāā has an enlightening passage in its first chapter titled
Sakhyāsvarūpam in which the value of a numeral in the place of ones is called its prakti and in higher places its vikti.WHAT IS INDIAN ABOUT INDIAN MATHEMATICS?
75
imagine that the abundant presence of numbers in
the visionary poetry that the gveda otherwise is
is a celebration of this supreme achievement, that
of bringing to the world of mortals what had
belonged to the gods.10
It is not a matter of chance that the concept
of the infinite has been a background presence in
the paragraphs above. No linguist, certainly not
after Pāini, could have overlooked the infinite
generative power of grammar, the inexhaustibility
of grammatical expressions and the impossibility
of enu-merating them all, that Pata–jali’s fable
highlights, just as no one interested in numbers
and how they are built up could have ignored their
interminability. The prehistory of numerical
infinity as the unattainable limit of counting
numbers – not just as a proxy for some vague
metaphysical notion – is, correspondingly, much
older than that of the complementary idea of the
zero. The awareness, or at least the suspicion, that
numbers had no end was already very much in
the air in the earliest Vedic times. The highest
power of 10 in the gveda is 104 with the name
ayuta, but almost immediately afterwords, the
Yajurveda, in both its recensions, has long lists of
powers of 10 by name, pushing the highest power
up to 1012 and further, in one list in the
Taittirīyasahitā, to 1019. An even more
interesting set of nine lists has numbers increasing
in constant steps rather than exponentially,
generally beginning with small numerals and
ending around 100. There are two reasons that
make these lists interesting and it is rewarding to
look at them closely:
1. They start for instance like ekasmai svāhā,
tribhya svāhā, . . . (depending on the
particular list) and after reaching 100 (śatāya
svāhā), invariably end with a sort of coda:
sarvasmai svāhā (and so does one of the power
lists: after loka = 1019, it is sarva). It is
impossible not to conclude that we are seeing
here the first explorations of the limits of
counting: no matter how one arranges the
count, there is no end to numbers; all one can
do is to stop at some point and let sarva be the
bridge that spans the totality of all numbers,
rather like the modern notational convenience
of · ··. The fascination with ever longer lists of
numbers kicked off by the Yajurveda
continued for a millennium and culminated in
the well-known episode from the Lalitavistāra
of Prince Siddhārtha’s pre-marital examination
in mathematics in which he astounds the world
with his knowledge and understanding of
impossibly (and unnamably) large numbers.
2. All numbers are cited by name. That meant
inventing new names for the higher powers of
10 (compoud number names being then taken
care of by grammar). They were taken from
the existing vocabulary, uas, samudra and so
on, without a direct numerical connotation, a
practice which quickly got out of hand and
led to the breakdown of a canonical association
of name and number. It would seem that the
pressure to find more and more names got to
the point where no one bothered to create a
system that could accommodate the logic of
the multiplicative process by which higher
powers were – in the mind – constructed. The
5th century Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu
speaks in one of his works of 60 named powers
of 10 but actually gives only 52 of them,
explaining that the other 8 have been
vismtam, lost to memory. It may appear to be
no more than an amusing episode to us but
the problem of matching numbers and names
in a unique fashion was a serious one; it is in
fact possible to argue that the compulsive need
to have an unambiguous name for every
conceivable number was what came in the way
10Parallels can be found in other places and at other times. Prometheus took from the gods not only fire but also the skill of
numbers. In India, at a later time when the Mahāyāna Buddhists were preoccupied with the endlessness of numbers and the
infinite multiplicity of the cosmos in space and time, the infinitely benevolent Avalokiteśvara, Bodhisatva of the infinitely
radiant Amitābha, was attributed Agni’s gift of acute vision.76
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
of an explicitly expressed recognition of their
inexhaustibility.
The reluctance to venture beyond the
nominal was bound to give way sooner or later.
Prince Siddhārtha in the Lalitavistāra adopts a
clever recursive technique to break free from the
tyranny of names: just describe the construction,
by a process of iterated powers of an already large
number, for example the number of grains of sand
in as many riverbeds as there are grains of sand in
one riverbed, and so on. The number of universes
of the Mahāyāna cosmogony occurs in the
discourse as does the word uncountable,
asakhyeya. Very soon afterwards (the Siddhārtha
fable is probably from the 3rd century AD), real
(not legendary) mathematicians had good
mathematical reasons to get to grips with infinity
in a more abstract setting. Both Āryabhaa and
Brahmagupta worked on a certain class of
equations called indeterminate and it turned out
that they had an unlimited number of different
solutions, an observation that was – finally! –
expressed through the unambiguous word ananta.
One would have thought that someone, a master
like Bhāskara II, would have come out and said
that the property of being ananta was a property
primarily of the counting numbers, but that did
not happen.
Ironically, the so-called classical period
also produced that most articulate champion of
the power of the spoken word, Bharthari, who
might well have been a contemporary of
Āryabhaa. At several places in the Vākyapadīya,
especially in those parts where he lays out the
general contours of his programme, the doctrine
is invoked according to which an abstract ‘thing’
is cognisable only by virtue of its being articulable.
Examples: “There is no cognition in this world
which does not involve the word (śabda). All
knowledge (jñāna) can be said to be intertwined
with the word”. Or: “All knowledge of what must
be done in this world (itikartavyata) is tied to the
word”. The synonymy that connects seeing and
knowing with naming has its roots, of course, in
the Vedic oral tradition; indeed, according to
Monier-Williams, khyā itself has the sense of ‘to
be named’ in the early Vedic corpus.
The Word never lost its power, even among
mathematicians: to name was to know, to cause
to exist. A millennium after Bharthari and two
millennia and a half after the Yajurveda, we find
the idea (ontological nominalism(?) if we must
have a name for it) reasserted by Jyehadeva in
the Yuktibhāā. Following the obligatory list of
the names of powers of 10 (up to 1017),
Jyehadeva brings together name, existence and
the concept of infinity as a number all in one
marvellously revelatory line: “ Thus, if we endow
numbers with [repeated] multiplication [by 10] and
[the 
consequent] 
positional 
variation
(sthānabhedam), there is no end to the names of
numbers; hence we cannot know the numbers
themselves and their order” (my emphases, of
course).
The paradox is that the fear of the
unknowable did not stop Mādhava and those who
followed him from employing sequences of
numbers tending to infinity as a key input in the
creation of spectacularly new mathematics, that
of calculus on the circle. Jyehadeva explains how
it is done, with care and a sharp mathematical
sensibility. The relatively unexciting role of
infinity in the new mathematics is that the final
results themselves are in the form of infinite series
whose successive terms are described recursively
but quite explicitly; they were, in that sense,
‘known’. The far deeper one was that of producing
geometrical quantities, for instance an arc, as small
as we please, by dividing a finite arc by a number
as large as we please. It does not bother
Jyehadeva that the divisors could not be given
names and therefore could not be known; it was
enough that a sequence of unboundedly increasing
numbers did the job. Nevertheless, there must have
been a conflict, as evidenced by the trouble he
takes to explain how the nominal imperative wasWHAT IS INDIAN ABOUT INDIAN MATHEMATICS?
77
subordinated to the demands of the mathematics
as it evolved. In the description of the actual
process of division, the divisor is first kept fixed
at parārddham (1017) which is the largest named
power of 10 in his list. It is then explained that the
method becomes increasingly (infinitely) more
accurate as 1017 is replaced by increasingly
(infinitely) higher powers of 10 and that
parārddham is just a notional number, used in the
description for definiteness of terminology. In
other words, Jyehadeva resolved the conflict by
first paying his dues to nominalism and then letting
the mathematics dictate what actually had to be
done. It is perhaps a measure of his unease that
the relevant passages are among the few where
the writing falls short of its usual clarity.
From a mathematical point of view, this
technique of ‘division by infinity’ is superior to
the early European attempts at defining
infinitesimals ab initio. Consequently, the Nila
calculus is sounder, conceptually and technically,
than that of Newton and Leibniz (though far more
narrowly circumscribed in scope). The distinction
may appear to be one of perception but it can be
traced, ultimately, to the two cultures’
understanding of the infinite. Central to calculus
is the notion of a limit which in turn needs the
notion of an infinite sequence – of numbers,
geometrical points, whatever – for its formulation.
For European mathematics, infinity as a
mathematically well-defined concept was not easy
to grasp, lacking as it did an intuitively natural
model for it such as the one provided by decimal
numbers. There are little asides in Newton’s
private notebooks expressing his prideful delight
at his discovery of “the doctrine recently
established for decimal numbers” – about three
millennia old by then in India – which he proposed
to use as a guide in the definition of infinite series.
8. NEW DIRECTIONS
The final brilliant act in the story of Indian
mathematics – as the Nila school turned out to be
– marked the advent of many other breakout ideas
which moved it away from its traditional moorings
and towards what we can recognise now as modern
mainstream mathematics. It is not possible to do
justice to this new orientation in a survey like the
present one. From today’s perspective, its most
salient feature is that mathematics began to be
driven more and more by its own internal logic
and not only by possible applications,
astronomical or otherwise. The development of
calculus was not really called for by any
astronomical problem; methods for dealing with
them to the necessary numerical precision already
existed. And, within that general framework, the
technical apparatus deployed owed little to the
past, pointing instead to what was still to come in
Europe. To give one example, Mādhava derived
the sine and cosine series in a sequence of steps
which can be summarised in the modern
vocabulary of calculus as follows: i) set up the
differential equations satisfied by the functions,
ii) convert them into integral equations, and iii)
solve them by iteration (saskāram). Merely to
list these steps is to establish their credentials as
essential components of modern analysis as it
evolved in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Foundational advances outside the domain
of calculus narrowly defined include the
introduction of an abstract algebraic approach in
a problem of no great practical value (estimating
truncation errors in series) and the consequent
recognition of the need to answer (and, indeed,
ask) questions like: what is a polynomial?
Jyehadeva has an amazingly modern
characterisation of the natural numbers as being
defined primarily by their property of succession,
as close to axiomatic mathematics as India ever
came. This was in turn prompted by the need to
justify entirely new techniques of proof –
mathematical induction – where traditional styles
of demonstration failed. The idea of proof itself
underwent a subtle change primarily, as we saw
in section 6, through Nīlakaha’s reflections on78

the question of how we know mathematical
propositions (and astronomical doctrine, but that
does not concern us) to be true. Their impact is
evident in the new rigour that is a hallmark of
Yuktibhāā: proofs are unambiguous and
complete, with a noticeably formal, structured
character to them.
What is interesting for us in these signals
of a modernising mathematical mindset is that,
together, they constitute a reassertion of the
universal character of all good mathematics;
Indian mathematics became less Indian so to say.
The old order began to give way, gradually, under
the impact of Mādhava’s originality; it is not easy
for a modern reader who has ‘seen it all’ to grasp
at first sight what an extraordinary transformation
of the ethos of mathematics Yuktibhāā represents
when compared to earlier writings. First and
foremost is the notion of a function as defined over
its entire natural domain, the circle – calculus is
fundamentally about functions with some
continuity properties – not just as its values at a
few selected points as was the case earlier. Then
there are the other manifestations of the new
autonomy: the assured handling of infinite series
and infinity itself in the abstract, free of the
constraints of nominalism; the abandoning of the
search for geometric justifications of arithmetical
and algebraic identities; the first formulations of
abstract algebraic concepts and methods; the first
whiff of axiomatisation in the treatment of
numbers; the stress on formally presented proofs;
and so on, each of them a first intimation of a
radical move away from long-held habits of
thought. And all of them anticipated, in an
embryonic form, the evolutionary stages
mathematics passed through in Europe following
the Cartesian revolution;11 perhaps it is a truism
that every great advance in mathematics is a step
towards its universal core. It is another story that
creative mathematics was brought to an end in
Kerala – and in India – before these shoots could
take root and flourish, at about the time that Europe
was embarking on its great voyage of scientific
and mathematical discovery. The tragedy is that
the opening up in the 16th century of extensive
maritime channels of communication between
India and Europe, instead of inaugurating an era
of mutually stimulating exchanges, had the effect
of bringing the curtain down on mathematics in
India; what was a new beginning in one culture
turned out to be an end in the other.
9. CROSS-CULTURAL CURRENTS?
The achievements of Mādhava and the
other Nila mathematicians and the new directions
they pointed to were subsumed in due course in
the explosive growth of mathematics in Europe
that began in the 17th century. And that leads to a
question the author have avoided so far, that of
the influences of different mathematical cultures
on one another or, in the spirit of my title: what is
non-Indian in Indian mathematics and, conversely,
what Indian traits can be identified in other
mathematical cultures? Much has been written,
and over a very long time now, about mathematical
give and take among different cultures, without
producing 
a 
proportionate 
degree 
of
enlightenment. The subject is a complex one
involving chronological priority, possible
mechanisms of contact and, most decisively,
assessments of commonalities in mathematical
themes and their working out. What makes a
rigorous and objective identification of
mathematical cross-currents across cultural
borders difficult, more so than in the case of, say,
linguistic borrowings, is the very universality and
immutability of the quarry: given propitious
circumstances, prepared and well-motivated
minds are as likely to unearth a mathematical “best
11 The one exception to this blanket statement about the Cartesian trigger is of course the axiomatic geometry of Euclid. But it was
only after Descartes that Euclid became the ideal to aspire to in other areas of mathematics (not to speak of other sciences and,
even, all human knowledge). An axiom system for numbers had to wait until Peano in the late 19th century.WHAT IS INDIAN ABOUT INDIAN MATHEMATICS?
79
of gems” at a given time and place as at any other;
we might even take that as an operational
definition of its universal identity and appeal.
In actuality, however, comparative history
of mathematics has not always been a shining
example of an objective and rigorous discipline.
Within the Indian context, it was perhaps natural
that colonial historians were not particularly
interested, especially from mid-19th century
onwards, in whatever data could be reliably
extracted or in what to do with them; the driving
urge was to derive everything from Classical
Greece.12 (It must also be said that some of the
earlier colonial historians – Colebrooke, Playfair,
Whish and some others – were much more open-
minded and did a commendable job with the sparse
material they had in hand). In the period following
the publication of the Śulbasūtra (by Thibaut,
1875), some Indianists dated Baudhāyana and
Āpastamba to the late centuries BC for no more
discernible reason than to preserve Euclid’s
primacy at least chronologically, regardless of the
philological evidence that both of them predated
Pāini. The Pythagorean theorem was a
particularly sensitive issue – and it must be
remembered that this was before the decipherment
of the Babylonian mathematical tablets and the
flutter they caused among historians of Classical
mathematics. The emphasis then shifted: is it
possible that the theorem of the diagonal came to
India from Babylonia?
The honest answer is that we still do not
know with certainty. Absolutely nothing is known
about any kind of contact between 18th century
BC Mesopotamia and the Vedic people who,
presumably, were making their first settlements
in northwestern India at that time. We do know
about extensive trade exchanges between
Mesopotamia and the Indus civilisation but that
was at its height 7 or 8 centuries earlier and had
come to an end. To confuse (or, maybe, clarify)
matters further, Indus artefacts have nothing
suggesting an acquaintance with the diagonal
theorem. In brief, and to come back where we
started, the known history of the Pythagorean
paradigm is very well accounted for if we are ready
to accept it as one of the great universal truths –
an element in the sense Proclus gave to Euclid’s
Elements – which more than one culture
discovered for itself. The same temporal mismatch
applies to the other great universal idea from
antiquity, place-value counting, and the
confusingly different ways it was implemented:
Indus Valley probably counted in base 8,
Babylonia, later, in base 60 and Vedic India, still
later (and orally), in base 10.
More generally, the readiness to accept
temporal antecedence (sometimes accompanied
by superficial similarities) as the determinant of
transmission is still a running motif in much
modern writing. Many examples can be given but
one that has found fairly wide acceptance will
suffice here. The background is the wholesale
importation into India of the Ptolemaic model of
planetary motion – as well as the supremely
important idea that such motions could be
described mathematically – during the so-called
Siddhānta period (the two or three centuries
preceding Āryabhaa), a true and well-documented
example of transmission. But Āryabhaa had no
use for the mathematics that (presumably) came
with it; he invented what he needed, mainly
trigonometry. Trigonometry was a bringing
together of two central elements of Śulbasūtra
geometry, the geometry of the circle and the
diagonal theorem, resulting in the key concept of
the half-chord as the natural linear object
associated to an arc. It is this object, the sine of an
angle, that helps turn much Greek geometry of
the circle into easy exercises in trigonometry, an
activity popular with some modern historians.
12The urge was of course not confined to mathematics. To take an example not too far removed from it, it was seriously argued that
the notion of syllogism in Indian logic was dirctly descended from Aristotle, a “prepostorous notion” in the words of one
preeminent modern logician.80
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
Āryabhaa’s famous table of half-chords takes no
more than a day’s work, if that, once the ideas are
in place (though it must be said that some of the
auxiliary ideas are themselves very deep). Now,
Ptolemy in Alexandria had made an admirably fine
table of full chords, not half-chords, in the 2nd
century AD but, in the absence of the
simplifications that trigonometry afforded, it was
laborious work. It shares nothing mathematically,
in spirit or in technique, with Āryabhaa’s work,
except that they both dealt with arcs of circles (and
were useful to astronomers). Nevertheless, it is
an old habit, still vigorously alive in certain circles,
to say explicitly or through implication that
Āryabhaa’s table – and other facets of his
trigonometry – is to be traced to a direct influence
of Ptolemy, or to a predecessor of his whose
surviving writings are, regrettably or fortunately,
far too fragmentary for a meaningful comparison
to be feasible.
The Almagest of Ptolemy and the
Āryabhaīya are among the most thoroughly
analysed of the astronomical texts of antiquity. The
fact that that did not prevent conjecture from being
put forward as historical fact – at constant risk of
reasoned repudiation – is as good a measure as
any of how mere age or received opinion (the
Indian equivalents would be śruti and smti) can
trump the evidence of our eyes and ears and our
minds. (Nīlakaha should be alive now). In the
middle of the last century, Bartel van der Waerden,
a historian of Greek science and its relationship
with Mesopotamia and a very distinguished
mathematician, went so far as to declare in effect
that no great mathematical advance is made more
than once independently and that all subsequent
‘rediscoveries’ are derived causally from that
original epiphany. Insights revealed to the chosen,
once and never again, do not sound very much
like the unvarying outcome of a universally shared
faculty of the human mind. But it is a temptingly
attractive position for a historian to take as it
absolves him or her from the responsibility of
searching for evidence of anything beyond
chronological priority. If van der Waerden had not
died in the 1990s, when the availability of the
relevant Indian material in European languages
was still poor, he might have come to realise that
his dictum can cut both ways; few even among
the knowledgeable knew, even as recently as that,
what Mādhava had achieved two and a half
centuries before calculus was invented in Europe,
which is about the same time span as separated
Āryabhaa from Ptolemy (and at a time of
enormously easier communications). The surprise
is that the dictum, not always consciously
acknowledged or consistently applied, still has a
following among today’s historians, vastly better
informed, or at least with the means to be.
It is not impossible that new data may
come to light one day that will require a
reevaluation of the earliest phase of Indian
mathematical history and its linkages with the
outside world. The broad picture we have today,
especially from the time of Āryabhaa onwards,
is of a tradition that is comfortably self-sufficient,
perhaps overly conservative and even insular. How
else can one account for the fact that during the
first centuries AD, a time when Indo-Hellenic
cultural contacts were so intimate and over such a
broad front – from astronomy to architecture and
sculpture – Euclid, and Greek geometry generally,
was so assiduously ignored or rejected? Whatever
be the explanation, Indian science as a whole was
the poorer for it. It never produced an Archimedes
(who too seems to have been unheard of in India),
someone with a vision wide enough to include
natural science outside astronomy as a part of
mathematical thought; there was in fact no physics
in India at any time if we exclude, as we should,
purely metaphysical speculations (on atomism for
example).
The dynamics of the episodes of a reverse
flow, from India, is much better understood,
simply because the evidence in support is of much
better quality. Here again, possible very earlyWHAT IS INDIAN ABOUT INDIAN MATHEMATICS?
81
cross-currents, for instance from the Indus
civilisation to Mesopotamia, remain uncharted. In
contrast, the much later spread of decimal
enumeration, first to Persia and the Abbasid
Caliphate and thence farther west, reaching Europe
in the 13th century, is very well documented. The
same wave carried Āryabhaan astronomy and the
mathematics that went with it, trigonometry in
particular, and played a huge part in the second
coming of Mesopotamian science in the following
centuries. Something similar happened with China
as well at about the same time, the agents of
transmission being Buddhist men of learning. That
the new arrival did not take to Chinese soil as well
as it did to the sands of Arabia, and declined in
step with the decline of Buddhism in that country
(in fact was abolished by royal decree at one
point), is perhaps another example of the role of
cultural predispositions in the welcome given to
alien knowledge. All of these instances illustrate
perfectly a conjunction of the conditions necessary
for a watertight case for transmission: priority,
established modes of communication, credible
documentation and, most critical of all, a
discernible impact on indigenous mathematics,
mutations of the mathematical DNA so to say.
It is legitimate to wonder now what the
great surge in European mathematics of the 17th
century – the birth of modern mathematics, quite
simply – might have owed to the rich but dying
Indian tradition. There is no doubt at all that the
‘new doctrine of numbers’, decimal enumeration
and its offshoots, had an absolutely decisive
impact, acknowledged by the mathematicians
themselves like Newton and Laplace if not always
by historians, most visibly in the maturing of
algebra as an autonomous discipline (as was also
the case in India). Brahmagupta’s work was known
in Islamic Spain but the direct inspiration for the
founder of modern number theory, Fermat, was
Diophantus of Alexandria (3rd-4th century AD),
who already had been translated into Latin by then.
Trigonometry, like decimal numbers, reached
Europe through Arabs, but later, and its adoption
into ‘pure’ mathematics (as opposed to, say,
cartography) was slower, perhaps because of the
hold of the geometric legacy of Euclid.
Mainstream geometry was almost exclusively
Euclidean, supplemented by the conics of
Apollonius. Above all, Descartes’ synthesis of
geometry and algebra through abstract graphical
reprsentations of functions, the most
transformative event of an eventful century, had
no Indian antecedents at all; no one on the banks
of the Nila drew the graph of the sine function.
It is against this background that we have
to judge whether word of Mādhava’s exploits
might have reached Europe and, if it did,
influenced the genesis of infinitesimal calculus
there. A positive answer would, of course, pass
the priority test. Channels of communication also
existed, especially with Kerala. But in the
mountains of paper the Portuguese generated, no
mathematical document with a link to Kerala has
so far been found (to my knowledge; it must be
added that two of their likely repositories were
destroyed: in Portugal as a result of the Lisbon
earthquake of 1755 and in Kerala in the burning
down of the great Jesuit library of Kochi by the
Dutch at almost exactly the time the young
Newton’s first ideas on calculus were
germinating). The more serious difficulty concerns
internal evidence; first indications – a proper study
remains a task for the future – are that the cultural
markers on the two avatars of calculus are as
distinctively individual as can be, given the
fundamental thematic unity. To mention only the
most prominent, there is no trace in Europe at all
of the Nila method of approaching the
infinitesimal limit by dividing by infinity. Its place
is taken by the subtle and original notion of the
derivative (Newton’s fluxion) or the differential
(Leibniz), without invoking directly the idea of
infinity at any point; presumably they were more
comfortable with quantities which are zero but not
quite zero than those which are infinite but not
quite infinite. Secondly, Europe was preoccupied
with many strictly local problems which needed82
INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
only the differential half of calculus for their
solution, such as the construction of tangents to
curves and the determination of their (local) high
and low points (maxima and minima of functions);
the problems treated by Mādhava were global, of
which the differential half was just a preliminary
to the integral half (rectification, quadrature).
There are good historical reasons for these
variations in taste and choice. The generality of
the structural approach that Europe discovered in
Euclid’s geometry and carried forward through its
algebraisation contributed significantly to the
vision Newton and Leibniz had of calculus. They
recognised from the start that the concepts they
were working with were applicable to very general
functions and curves and said so explicitly; and it
is probably not an accident that Fermat, before
them, had made seminal contributions to the
founding of both analytic (Cartesian) geometry
and calculus. Add to this the role physical science,
in particular mechanics (which also was in the
process of being created as an exact science),
played in the work of both Fermat and Newton
and we have an idea of the ambition that the new
discipline was born with. The Nila mathematicians
came nowhere near that kind of breadth and scope,
not because of any inherent limitation in their
methods as we know now – division by infinity is
as versatile as the European infinitesimal limit –
but because they were content with solving the
handful of particular problems they were
interested in; it was a cultural thing. Alto-gether,
it is fair to say that if there is a convincing case
for any significant influence on European calculus
of what happened in distant Kerala, that case is
still to be made. The circle of ideas surrounding
the discipline of calculus is one of the great
universals of mathematics and it should surprise
no one that more than one gifted mind found its
way to it.
A final thought. Just as our mathematical
ancestors were creatures of their milieu, so are
those of us who study their achievements, as best
we can, of ours. In these days of scholarship by
assertion, that is all the more reason for us to heed
Nīlakaha’s advice about separating true
knowledge from false: trust our senses for the data
and our thinking minds for what we can deduce
from them; ignore all else, whether revealed in
the sacred texts (śruti) or handed down by mere
mortals (smti), when they go against facts and
logic.
