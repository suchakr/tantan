Namaste welcome to Forum we're going to continue our conversation with professor
arangar in the last recording we we spoke quite a bit about the Vic
tradition and astronomical Skies observation in the Veda we are going to take that conversation today Professor
anger thank you for being with us again and really appreciate you giving us the
time here Namaste Namaste Professor if you don't mind I just want to recap a little bit of what we spoke in the last
episode and then we can continue uh we started off at the Vic tradition the observations of the sky the movement of
the Sun the M of the Moon the importance of the Dasa Pam Masa in the understanding how the Earth the eclipse
of the moon happens and then the knowing the phases of the moon as well so that
those were very complex observation must have been observed over a lot of time then we also spoke about the T araka
related to the Dua nakshatra then they recognized in the poar which was
previous to what we currently have so that was an extremely important aspect being in the shishima constellation then
we also spoke about a little bit about meteors and comets so which were very important aspects of of the Vic
tradition then also I think the important number you covered was about 3339 which is related again to the
damasa so is this a correct understanding of what was in the actually the mainly the araka the samita
and aranyaka text is that a good understanding yeah Mr subramanyam what you say is true last time we covered
what I would call the Vic Skies the VC
Skies was initially well we don't know when they started observing maybe the
fourth millennium BC or even earlier than that initially it was Disturbed at
least that is the feeling I get from the redic text and other texts Disturbed
means because of the maybe comets maybe asteroid impacts or maybe storms
whatever it may be which led to a lot of difficulties and that also encouraged
people to look at the sky more carefully to pray of course to the sky and to the
dietes the Unseen dieties certainly even today we do the prayers they did that
that is the cosmic prayer was always there so the concept of Cosmos cosmology
and who are we what is the connection between Earth and the universe these
questions are all there in the Vic State itself which as per the ti which I
showed the discussed the shishima and the Dua belongs to the third millennium
BC that is about 3,000 BC let us say 3,000 BC so during the same period a few
other things also got developed like the meu model because Dua was fixed whether
it is possible that sun and moon they may be going around Dua and an imaginary
meu mount meu something like an imaginary shaft which connects Earth
with the sky with the North Pole all these things started in the third
millennium BC itself and observation of moon and the
damasa even though the text and the theory for them may be later like the
Shas sutras they belong generally as accepted they were written down a group
of these because they belong to the vanga they are not the Veda directly they are the
vangas the kalpas are the vangas the sacrifices and the Dua I told you
Dali and how if the Dua stal is displaced they may be able to even
displace a powerful person or an emperor that kind of thing that was all there in
the third millennium transition to the second millennium BC now I feel that in
the second millennium BC we are already coming to the vanga period I can't fix
up exactly the dates but it was a transition there would be overlapping
lot of overlapping between Rua Yura and other Vedas and also the vangas so you
were summing up is correct so the Vic period what we see in the directly in
the Vic text proper Vedas as such which comprises of the samhitas the brahmanas
and to some extent the Aras or The Vedas what we in India would traditionally
recognize as V now the vanga period comes next so you are summing up is very
good okay if if I may so the vanga you
talking going to talk about Vang lag we have come up to lagada is that so
information that have observations are in the vanga also oh no this is a very
loaded question that is what was happening between the third millennium BC and the
second millennium BC second Millenium would be something like let me say 1300
1,400 BC now lagadas joa is popularly
called vanga joa you know it was published about 100 years back at that
time joa is one of the vangas was known but there was no other known text as
vanga joa so everybody started calling lagadas calendar see lagadas calendar
there are two calendars one is called the ARA joa that is a Ric calendar
second one is the yusa joa that is the AIC calendar but what is available in
print right today is a combination of the two that would be about 50 shlokas
50 vers it is only about the how to find the Titi where sun is located in which
nakshatra if you start from the winter Sol ST which based on the nakshatra that
he gives that is the Shish nakshatra which has been identified generally as
beta delin in the modern notation this goes to about 1,300 BC now but between
2,800 and 1,300 what was the situation in the country I said something about dap and
these all practical things developed yagas were being done rituals were being
conducted there are so many other satas gaam and measurement of time all that
was happening I'm sure that was happening but is there something which is more comprehensive than l is the
question because doesn't say anything about planets lag doesn't say anything
about eclipses nothing about comets nothing about even full moon so where are we if
the Vic period they observed this guy with so much of care and concern what
happened in between we had to question that yes yeah and that uh you want to
ask something yes exactly and so that is where we come to the parar Tantra is
that yeah you're right see the I will say because you talking about what I've
been doing and I have done so this is the parar Tantra so last time I told you
that I started with the earthquakes and the kilari earthquake and so on so forth
I will not go back into that so when I searched the he quotes parar and Vas so these
were the two astronomers I was very much interested in because both of them are
more ancient at least thousand years before from the data that is given and
hence even the traditional indologists agree that both vashar and Vaga are more
ancient than vaham who was in fifth and sixth Century ad so that means preetan
astronomy if I have to get anything it has to be only from from parashar and V
now parasara actually has been quoted
extensively not by but by his commentator called BPA was
a kashmirian who has written a excellent commentary on brat samita and there was
another equally talented King who was originally from Karnataka but who joined
the paa Kings and later on he was became the SAA in the mithila region so he
ruled over mithila in the 10th to 12th century that was balala so balala was from kataka and
he ruled the mea region it's a variety of things because of the national integration that has happened in our
country over thousands of years and he was equally talented he wrote a book
called adut Sagara abbut Sagara is only about special events in the sky special
events on the earth and in the atmosphere last time I told you there is a threeway
categorization Anar and so that is Earth atmosphere and sky
so these are the three regions and in which anomalous events whatever can happen he has listed them it is an
encyclopedia actually unfortunately not many people don't they don't know about
it it has been published in Varanasi in the beginning of the 20th century and if
you see that he extensively quotes parashara because parasara wrote in Pros
he did not write in verses so this is a key to understand older text from later
text the later texts are going to be mostly in versified form even the santic astronomers wrote In
whereas the pridan people they wrote in Pros like the Vic Brahman ARA text that
is how they wrote in Pros so parashara's text was I was interested in what he
says about earthquakes then I found that he also has something to say about
planets eclipses and comets and the most important thing about parasara was about
comets and he gives a list of 26 comets which visited which were visible so to
say by human beings and please note he gives the inter arrival time of these
comets that means between two comets how many years had elapsed and if you add
all of this elapsed years it comes to about 1,200 or 1,300 years I have
published this in the Indian Journal of History of Science already just a second
what you're saying is they recorded comets spanning 1,200 years with
everything each each Comet having 30 40 years Gap but and listing what 26 com
comets did you see 26 comets the average will be around 85 to 86 years or
approximately 100 years you can say roughly of that some of them are very
short period statements are also there there are also comments he says they
come at 130 there are some which are at 125 years
like that now this put me into a big question mark if I can decide when
parasara lived what is the origin of his school I can add 1,200 years and
obviously he would not have seen all of this it is a long time record maybe
inherited maybe oral which could have come only through the Vic tradition because in the millennium BC I already
talked to you about all of those things so there should be something there so hence I was very seriously looking into
parasara and about comets now the date of parasara he gives a solar zodiac the
solar zodiac as you know is to decide the position of sun in the sky with
reference to time on Earth just to give an example now we use 12 months now each
month if sun moves from one place to the another place today we say he travels
two and a quarter nakshatra or one Rashi see one Rashi is actually a sign which
says from the eox it is done just a second profor just for our viewers to So
when you say when the sun moves it is early in the morning before Sunrise what constellation is seen at the point where
the sunrise so so before it rises you can see a Major constellation and every day it changes a little bit and then
over a period of a year we cycle through the 27 conation and that also goes
through Precision yes see the issue is again Precision I'm coming to that Precision that is the important thing
now in the the year started that Isa started
with theu we have to understand this see in in India even today we call the year ASA
you see whicha particular in Canada you know
like that and that is connected with the Hindi Baris Baris is
alsoa and when with the rain season the year started that is why it was calleda
the year was called and that is in the Maga nakra when the gishu ended and the
started that is how in the it is given now there only two ayas there he doesn't
say anything about months anything about Seasons they might have known but it is not recorded that's what I'm telling he
says that the summer Sol started with the Maga nakra up to Winter Sol which is
half of Shish I given also the statements Shish
after to half now how do I know the date of this I have to decide which is maatra
which is Shish nakshatra translate them into modern notation of leonis or maybe
Aquarius or beta aquery or beta delin something like that and presses it back
because the suers St is going to be 90° longitude winter Sol St will be 270°
longitude for sun because Equinox is 0° so the movement of the equinoxes or the
Precision of the Equinox as it is called is same as the Precision of Sal nakra
also that has to be done and for that I need an anchor point is a zero point now
in parasara he says his ear started with the winter Sol St with Shish with the
first part of shisha that is sectors the the nakas are
visible stars but these are sectors Shi he says he says Ana he says so these are
the ending points it is like the modern longitude a 0 de beginning end half that
kind of thing but they didn't have the angular measure at least it is not there but they had these kind of Concepts and
the whole zodiac was divided into 27 equal parts s they were called the
nakshatras Within These sectors there were stars identifiable Stars so they
visible you can make an arbitrary division why 27 you can make it into 100 divisions but they had 27 that is again
coming from the Vic side so in the third millennium fourth Millennium they were
already observing they had observed the bright stars maybe with the moon maybe
sometimes with the sun and all that that knowledge was formalized in the second
millennium BC now parasara gives some of this information and it is a solar
zodiac is a seasonal solar zodiac it was not Rashi it was not month but Seasons
because seasons are felt so you have the rain so it's the it is hot it is the
grishma and also the light changes that is a sunlight the day is longer in
summer day is shorter in winter this kinds of things are also there and in the winter Sol St sun is extremely below
the Horizon to the South I have sent last time also about those things
whereas in the Summer sun is very high above in the northern side these are all
Vic Concepts because the name utara the name d they all come from the Vic Watson
in the that means he does a prak that is why the word d has come to your right
when you stand seeing East the sun all this information so parar gives an
Adara that is when Sun starts in the winter Sal St beginning of the shisha
similarly he gives the seasons four and half nakshatras make a season so he
lists the boundary stars that is the season starts with the following nak
that is how he gives the
statement p is going to be raati half so shishir is from shishi up to raati
Middle similarly that is from that
starting he says so up to the end of rohini it is going to be wasu kind of
thing continues like that but this is a pretty complex and uh very very good
observation so then of course of course a very good observation so that is what you see once the Sal the solce point
they understood that sun stand still in the north and in the South when Dua was
not there fixed we have to understand this Dua was always in the background
but Dua unfortunately was not fixed so they had to devise a new way because any
movement has to be with reference to a fixed origin so he picked up the winter
Sol St because winter Sol is Sun stand still same as lagada lagada also takes
the same thing but Paras is more detailed because of the Comets as I told you so if Paras was 1300 let me say
approximately if I add 1,200 years for the Comets maybe I go to 2,500 or 2,600
BC and what happened at that time it says the first comment
was is floods the first flood during the first flood a called wasak appeared he
says and 130 years after thatu came so it go like chal there and
and it caused lot of Destruction because earthquakes occurred and the kurukshetra
was destroyed so many details are there available and because of my interest in
earthquakes I had to see because many tectonic upheavals have happened because
of asteroid impact today you know that is the prime question internationally
and NASA is working with bringing the samples of the asteroids and trying to
see what was the initial formation of the universe itself and these questions
were there at that time also but with whatever facility that was available
they did that much so he has recorded all of that now this 1300 BC is with the
winol St now if you see between 2,800 BC
and the 1,400 BC or whatever was there no fixed point for
peoplea why did it say it was Maga M it says it doesn't
say it starts with mag beginning Point winter solce is M no winter solce is
Shish winter is that is for lag also
yeah so that is how this parasara business was there but parasara is being only quoted by later people by as I said
utpala and balal about the astronomical things see V simply mentions his name
here and there he doesn't extensively quote him and he all that quotation
comes from his commentator and doesn't say anything about the inter
arrival time of comets he would have known it because he would have exposure to paras's book otherwise he couldn't
have qued him like that but he says comets are Beyond mathematics so he was
unwilling to accept the inter arrival time that is fine as a rationalist so he says he doesn't say anything he just
leaves it like that whereas Bala gave all the details as it is quoted that is
what I have picked up and in the book I have compared between balala and also
BPA BPA also quotes some differences some identities but both have the same
author in words parasar tradition is
well known it was living even up to the 12th century because bat was in the 10th
century balala was in the 12th the 200 years difference they knew parar now a
new person also comes into picture there that is also is there now parar as I said I
could not get any manuscripts for him see when the my book was released in
Bangalore in the Mythic Society you know Professor rodam narima yes is
ANS yeah correct as an extraordinary person was worked in also on History of
Science was knowledgeable in Sanskrit and a internationally well-known
scientist he came for the release of the book and in the lecture he said now that
we have he has published parasa from quotations you people have to go and search for the manuscript of parashar
well we did we couldn't get anything so far I haven't got but as a compensation
I got V so that is the next part of the story so to say so manuscripts before
the pandemic itself I had started collecting his manscript but inra is there a reference to austa where
does austa come oh oh yeah oh yeah it's a very good question austa a see the older text as I said the
pridan text they start with questions large number of questions like in the
kenish there are questions who why what that kind of thing the student as
parasar I see a bright light in the South it is unlike the planets which
rise in the east and set in the west but it rises in the south it also sets in
South only sometimes seasonally I see it why seasonally because shukra is not
seen every day shukra when shukr happens rises in the West after some time he he
seen in the west so he asked such a question who is this it's called austa
what is the story behind so he's comparing V shukra Venus with austa he's not exactly comparing Venus but from the
statements you can see because the planets which which are
along the ecliptic he says jotish chak he says there in the East and the West
whereas this is unlike either of them unlike any of these that is what he says
and he says it rises and sets there itself that is in the South roughly in
the South itself now parasara explains that he gives the story The Vic story
that he went South the windya was rising and he wanted IND should not rise till
he comes back and all that and that is why he is kept in the South and all that
he tells the story first but he also says a Rises when is in
the he says he says in every year inra
that is modern day called corus constellation so when sun is in the
corus constellation austa rises in the South and he sets when sun is in the
rohini constellate rohini is going to be the Alan near alaban now this can be
dated now quite a bit of work has been done by there's one professor of astronomy in the University of Hyderabad
called abank now Dr abank was an extraordinary person he was a modern
astronomer and he was also a very good Sanskrit scholar so he had studied many of these things he worked on Mahabharata
he worked on some of these things he wanted to see what is this austa business but he did not know parasar but
he knew about austa being there in all the santic astronomy books so all the
sidhan astronomy books devote one chapter to austa and austa is so
important even today in India ARA has to be given to austa when austa Rises
particularly in West Bengal in Mya region in all those regions it's a very important Festival even in South it is
there in the temples mostly not so much people do that but in the north the
Kings had to do this that was a very very important ritual for them it continues even today the badra Masa they
do it you know it is said like that well anyway that is another matter show but this was visible from
the ketra region right from the heart of the correct correct correct correct and
this can be dated so abanka did the dating because ausia is a Southern Star
is below the Equator so it would be visible in the southern hemisphere is a different thing it's a southern
hemisphere star because of the rotation of the earth the yearly rotation of the
earth some Seasons it comes up up to some particular latitude to be visible
now because Reda talks of AA Vic people knew about austa and all our puranas are
full of austa ramayana Mahabharat whever you go Tamil Nadu see austa is the
leading Rishi for Tamil Nadu he's the founder of Tamil language as it is said
and also of the vakar Tamil vakar so there is so much story about austa and
austa is in the South saparis are in the north the seven saparis and austa
together they form the gotra these y are the
progenitors of all Hindus who believe in the vas there can be nothing more
stronger than this being from the north to south combined this is in the text
this I'm not telling that so the Rishi is the austa forming
the gotra now this would have been visible in the kurukshetra region for the Vic people already by about 4,000 BC
they might not have understood everything about it but Agusta Rising they would have seen that is a new light
which is coming up in the South and the importance of austa is even today it
doesn't rise to very high altitudes day by day it rises and in the initial
stages that is in 4,000 BC when it started coming out it would have risen
for only 3° 4° altitude then set in
other words austa would have been a dwarf and austa iconography is a
dwarfish iconography yeah all over India including Nepal shown as a dwarf you see
the relationship of her culture to the skies how the Vic observation of the sky
merged in the day-to-day life of not just Vic pandits or just of brahmins it
went up to the all the levels of the society yes dispersed kind of diffused
into all sect of the Society and also there is another point that austa even
today is not visible Beyond 38° you know
say 38° North or 40° here in Hartford I can't see austa maybe you may be able to
see there but I won't be able to see in this latitude so to say that the the r
ganita is from Rome and things like that is not right because in Rome you can't
see austa even today yes so these are some of the by products we get from
studying pridan astronomy astronomy preetan astronomy so your question I'm
very happy about AUST wonderful so was the key person right so
we have all the excerpt from the parasar Tantra and then later on we see the
ragara text again that's a layer text you have old observations and then new observations there as well yeah you are
right you are right so let me tell my story again once this Paras Tantra book
was completed I was still looking for Vaga in fact Vaga quotations are also
available like parasar was quoted Vaga is also quoted so I wrote a paper
already combining these two what we know about ragara and parasara even before I
published my book and before I got the manuscripts because we're based on quotations and I made a conclusion also
that we should look for the manuscripts now the story becomes more interesting
people have been looking for mascs like pingry pingry is a well-known person know has his sensus of exact Sciences in
Sanskrit so he has collected a magnum opus he has publ a four volume book on the manuscripts in
India which are unpublished and some are published kind of so I went through that and large number of G statements are
there he also knew about parasar not that he did not know but he simply says
he did not say anything about parasar Tantra because he has not come across that he writes parashara
quotations and he simply says par is woman astrology it doesn't have any astronomy is what he said but I found
that it is not true parashar had some astronomy and it's not totally portant
and wans and things like that hence is a little bit skeptical about uh Ping's
cataloges and ping work nevertheless he has given something for us to refer yes
so I collected garas manscript are available whatever it is I would collect
it I said and from before the pandemic started you know got one or two
manuscripts and studying them reading the manuscripts very hard to read the MS
directly but I went on reading them it's a huge collection so to say because the
G is one thing G samita is different samita is different Gali is different G
prashna is different G Manor is all with g g there may be something like 100 such tax
available I collected 25 of them I sampled I mean a statistically I said I
will sample this from here and there because I can't pay even for all of that but anyway I had some projects which you
purchased some we got just like that and I got a manuscript called G samita even
from Nepal because it was also called samita so you see that if we have to
work on Indian manuscripts we have to be very careful about the catalog names it is
not like the catalog names I see in my library yeah where the author name is
there the number is there year is there and all that so manuscript libraries in India very difficult correct the name
maybe something inside may be something else four or five books may be combined and they would call it by the first name
variety of problems are there and you see that there is something like 5
million manuscripts are yet to be brought out in catalog properly
yeah catalog is there some catalogs are there but nobody knows what is inside
the name is there where it is available and even par Tantra may be available
somewhere it may not be catalog because we have looked into only the catalogs and available things because we to
physically go to the library see what is there and all that you know some are online now it is better day by day
situation is improving that is right but I'm talking of what was the situation 25 years back when I started working on
this when I was still at the Indian Institute of science working on parashar manuscripts and Gara manuscripts to look
for earthquakes now let me cut the story short now after the 25 manuscripts are
collected which incidentally I will be publishing one part of this manuscript
called Mah Salam the central Sanskrit university has agreed to publish it has
been edited using 11 manscript of
vsha what I call see the g samita g samita g samita they later things which
have come from the students or the family members of Gara so who was garga
don't ask me they belong to the Garra but it could be anybody later it can be
even students g means even student of G is called G as theas are also Gia that
means children also Gara that we will not go into those details and these are
all touted as astrology books actually if you see today they will say G G man
that is an astrology book Gap prashna that is from Kerala somewhere it has
been published and it is an astrology olog book that is how it is there but I was very skeptical it cannot be
that so went through all of that now I've been working on this for the last nearly 10 years
the of the 25 manuscripts 11 manuscripts are astronomical and also they belong to
a period before Arata because they don't have Rashi or
if Rashi is there in oneok or somewhere it is an interpolation that means nowhere else you find it it will just
somebody might have when these mascs are copied and copied and copied every 200
years somebody might have thought his rash somewhere has to introduce or whatever
happen he would have written somewhere in the corner or somewhere for his reading now when you collect L
manuscripts they are from different regions Kashmir Rajasthan Maharashtra
Madia Pradesh West Bengal Varanasi kind of myour so it has been copied in
regions differently also even the scripts may be very peculiar but these
manuscripts as it is available to us today the paper cannot be older than 500
years paper or the medium cannot be older than 500 years because they would lost by that time yes so what is lost we
don't know let us not worry about it what is there is what we are studying so
so if I go through this initially we thought that I would Ser try to publish
the manuscript just see reading and Publishing reading and Publishing but I
could not understand some of the initial part itself see the manuscript is so
good he gives a Content also so the contents what are there in this Vaga
tradition gives the contents so that in the manuscript if something else is there you know somebody else has had it
was not due to the original person or there is a difference I have to be very careful I can give both but I have to be
very careful a simple thing I will tell you in the Nepal manuscript
the is a viya it has nothing to do with
astronomy it tells how to find the East direction that is there to that extent
is that's all there is nothing else it is totally which belongs to 400 BC in the magada
region and all that of that is the Nepal manuscript now this vagar joa which is
available in mland India it also has a viya chapter six chapters it has nothing
to do with the Nepal text theokas are different the text is different the
intentions are also different the methods of construction are also of course wood Timber is common whereas
Timber was used in the Nepal region knows only Timber doesn't say anything
about Stone whereas this mland text talks about Stone knows about definitely
Timber but it talks abouta also some metal Also it talks about so you can see
the difference but it's a cultural thing which is there and spread all over well anyway that is another interest in was
in architecture because that is also an equally important thing not go into that so coming back to this vagar joa when
myself with Sudan whom you know very well we started publishing the initial
chapters there are so many technical terms which you could not understand so went on reading the manuscript reading
the manuscript I came to a Pros part called the Mah Salam which is the 24th
section 24th section is not the 24th chapter because each section has four
chapters five chapters six chapters the total text is about 125 chapters about
6,000 shlokas okay oh that's huge large text 6 it is a large text it is some
yeah it is about4 of ramayana exactly so it it is of such large text but quite a
bit is layered and interpolated because in different periods people have added
that is the interesting thing now this are not not known to me so when I went
through this I mean as a research work I would be very happy if I find something new which is not known now in the Adara
chapter he gives the same solar zodiac as parasar that was a revelation for me
parar gave his zodiac in Pros whereas in Thea manscript I don't know who is the
author so one of the gaga gaga one Gaga 2 Gaga 3 Gaga 4 whoever he may be he
also gives the same and he quotes actually what has written would have quoted from
G he would have known the he says the beginning how it happens
the same thing is so the interesting thing
witha is he gives the nakra composition
how many stars are there in each nakshatra and he gives also the names of
these nakshatras very clearly so that we can build up a catalog of the nakshatras
which in the second millennium BC these people would have seen to come to an
understanding on what may be the seasonal boundaries now this work because the
nakshatra sectors have to have the stars and you know The Vedas Give the names of
the stars M that ktia has six stars then JTA has three stars shishta has four
stars kind of thing so the total number of stars is not 27 nakas are 27 many
people mistake this total number of stars is 80 six shash that is the 86
stars now how do I come to a conclusion when these things were there because
there are so many stars now see for in the lagadas case there is only one star
so people right or wrong did something now in the Paras case he doesn't say
anything he gives only the bright stars which was there so I can I could get an
upper bound and a lower Bound in Vaga he gives more detail so what we did we did
a minimum error analysis a minimum error analysis is going to be start from 3,000
BC find out the error in the Solar zodiac and the Chas where it is a
minimum it attains a minimum around 1300 BC then again it keeps on increasing in
other words the names of the stars and the name of the sectors have to match
yes otherwise you have no way of doing things you know if say sector the nakra
visible Katra should be in the critical sector this is what is missing later on
in the joa that is in the pal and astrology today's astrology but our
entrance were very careful on this and the same text has one more chapter there
is the 59th section towards the end which gives called a rutu swaba which
has six seasons but it gives the monthly stars that sun moves through a
particular star so um so just to step back so this we can see now the change
so what was a season approach by just looking at the larger Seasons right
where the beginning of the sun and the ending of the sun now there is more detail with the more more detail
specific correct correct you're right and that is why the development of
astronomy the schools of parasar and Vaga if I had to put parashar was
first essentially observation to combine with planets it will take more time
parashara gives the period of Venus gives the period of Jupiter gives the
period for Saturn gives the period for Mercury but not for angaraka that is not
for Mars whereas V gives something for Mars also that is this text which I
collected as an angara chapter where the siderial period it's the number is
approximate but anyway the sideral period is given what we call a pseudo cidial period nowadays because cidial
period cannot be observed you know the codic period and you make an I mean an argument with which you come to the
you'll say 1/ Alpha minus 1/ beta = to 1 / s and then find out the cidial period
like that because the modern definition of cidial period is somewhat different whereas these people took come to the
same star start with a star comes to the same star exactly now
now for angaraka parasar knew the retrograde motion that is vakti he knew
he gives the wakati that angara can have in aakrati and gives the names of the vakra also
this is another very interesting thing in Indian so just I mean just to inform viewers sir so what happens is when the
stars are or the planets are moving in the sky you see them go forward every day and then sometimes you see it in the
opp opposite direction and then it again next day when you see it it moves forward so that is the retrograde motion
yeah so all these observations were being kept track right yeah there is something more there in the observation
that's what I wanted to say that has something to do with the language and the naming you know so the language and
naming and these These are technical words and how did they select how did they do that see for example cria means
cutter something like something which Cuts Like a Knife and if you see the constellation cria we have given all of
that the figures also it looks like that A constellation now these are not the rashis these are the 27 nakat and if you
say maga maga has six stars it looks like it is called a kostara kostara
means a boundary wall or a house or a room it looks like that if you can join
those six stars so the names Denzel tell you how to ident identify not all but
many of them I've discussed that in the book I will not go into the details of that because for mahum and the vi vanga
astronomy this is all important because what is vanga it has to explain the vas
now both parasar and V explain the vas the Comets the nakshatras the austa all
of that are explained but Thea gives more details also like in the
Das the central V is because of the moon's orbit moon's orbit how would they
know they have to see the sky and see moon is going like this like this and this is the shape Paras does the same
thing for Angar he says it is like AA or V via is like a snake which goes
forward comes and then goesa is not that it's like a not it is
angaraka if you see even today sometimes it can have a knoted kind of thing comes
back loops on itself crosses the older path and goes onto the other side you see the Nas I have put up the figures in
my book also so he calls it is like knife going down like
this which is held in hand is like this whatever analogy they had in their mind
they given that now this vsha as I said the 59th section theaba
belongs to 500 BC already he gives the months name the solar month it is the sa
it is not just the season whereas parasara doesn't talk so much about the the might have known the months because
the Pima occurs somewhere so that might have be the month but that was not in wogue so much because the season which
was inok now vsha if you see the 24th section was the most interesting
Because unless that was understood the technical words we could not understand the other chapters and that is mAh that
Maham belongs to around 1600 BC and it
starts the year with the Maga nakra the and the
Su it clearly says the is there ay is the lateral movement yes not just for
sun but for Moon also Ma
me this means this lunar for the ayas maatra is thei from that nakra you have
to count for the most part the moon follows the sun right because they're in the same plane but there may be slight
change about four five degrees with the with the moon no it what is AA we have
to see yeah see AA is not just the lateral movement in those days AA would
have been there are two AAS extreme point to extreme Point yes is called an
so in a year there are two AAS one is north to south second is south to
North means even moon has north to south and south to North yes and mahasa gives
for 10 solaras there are 134 lunar AAS that means 10
Solara means 5 years 134 lunar means 67
siderial Cycles so the siderial cycle of the moon was established at least
available in writing for us in around 1600 BC this was 300 years before lagada
lagada also gives 5 years the 62 codic months also so he gives
now also knows theic period but not the mahasa mahasa knows the and all of that
it recognizes should be done and he gives the quations and all that it
calls as so the word TI is used
therei it says so that is something like the end it is like a book end you start
from somewhere come to the same end it is like I would say in in English you would say 10th 12th Maybe person or
maybe the row 10th Row the t is there it is called the in Sans the gives the
gives rise to the word and TI of course in pinga Singa variations are there and
Mahabharata also uses the word TI today we think TI is only in a particular
sense we take it no that is a lunar thing is what we take it yeah but in the
older time the word Titi was used for Pima as an instantaneous time even mahab
Basha gives this the kala when moon is full is called PA SOA is as a day you
take it it is for 30 M 24 hours no it is not like that it is an instantaneous
thing now you just think about it paima he says in their own language the moon's
face becomes full and that is POR that instant and then he says the
cycle begins again it goes through then there is another worda that s has taken
me so much effort to find out what is this because it comes in
the in the Ang in the content chapter itself that has been wrongly interpreted
wrongly written wrongly published and so many things have happened and S if you
see the dictionary it only says it is a hav which should be given on Amasia day
which is offering to be given yeah yeah it is an offering of mix of ADI and Kira
that is milk and curs has to be given but mahasa clearly says
Amasia is taken thenaya comes and after that D
comes that isaya is continuously taking amas towards d d is the scene yes D is
to see that is the new moon what in English also called New Moon D but the
is the reciprocal of that is the instant in which the conjunction has taken place
the two are together so it is a continuous moment they knew that you see in the last lecture also I told you
about Indra drinking 30 legs of things so it is a continuous time so here also
they knew that s is used in that sense s is also given he knows that his says
that gave the 17th thing as the S and that is how it happen that is from the
Vic inheritance that is done but it isaya word is used that is the
conjunction so these are the things which become important this is in the mahasa this mahasa mahasa which is in
Pros cor which reads something like Brahman text see we we invited group of
Vic people Vic practitioners in Bangalore last December to have a
two-day seminar where people from Nepal had also come two people from Varanasi
had come and also others had come and Bish archaeologist you know him you know
who excavated invited quite a few people because we wanted to know what was the pre BCE thing as What We Are Climbing
does itel with people what do they feel and they said this reads like a brah
text many of them did not know English they knew only Sanskrit corresponded
with them and well anyway is another matter this is not known this text is
not known it has been lying idle added to this our pingry and Company had to go
back I'm sorry I have nothing against them I have benefited by pingry definitely he has given a list of
chapters in the what he calls the G he doesn't want to call it V he gives G and
in that he says salila is there the name is there because it in the content so in
the text it was there Salam so Sal he says rainfall and the same thing has
been picked up by a few other people who are recently published on
garsha they don't want to call it v g they want to call it only Gia that's okay that's a different matter and pingi
also said this text has nothing to do with the Vang theang of for the Y There
Is A Commentary see how the Sanskrit intellectual tradition gets mixed up and
unless we unot them correct and then understand it properly we don't get
anything superficial you see you get only a superficial result in the
Yasha has been published has been printed by sudakar of course the some of the
readings are wrong I have marked it in my book also what was wrong that is different matter and he quotes Gara
which statement is exactly there in the mahum of the what I am now publishing I
don't know how ping would say that this is not found anywhere this vanga cannot
be considered as I mean belonging to G thing kind of thing now these are the
new issues which come up and we have to sort it out and hence to give continuity
to my previous see the gar text
Thea text which collected the 11 manuscripts contain this mahasa and this
24th section is actual vanga that means it explains the Vang vas see the Maham
is the 24th section contains two chapters totally in Pros a Vic Pros
prean PR uses the word kurti not karoi
kind of thing so such kind of usages are there and this as I said we had a
two-day meeting with the Vic pandits and thetis who practice the to discuss about
the damasa and also about the vanga joa of mahasa not the lagada lagada in
comparison is trivial there are three numbers based on those three constants you can construct anybody can construct
the kind of thing he gives the algorithms that is the important thing with lag whereas parasar and Vaga they
were observers they talked about planets eclipses occultation of stars parasara
gives occultation of stars and also something which could be the
introduction to astrology the Vic astrology that was also there both in
parasar and also in V so as I showed you the parashar Tantra
Anda Adara belong to 1300 BC so in around 1300 BC there were three people
you can say parashara first next G next lag but
where did they get these things thousand years before question is I know that
M starts sum with Maga not with Danish
Shish so what happened in between was the question mahasa fills up this this
mahasa is also available in the same manuscript collection which I collected from our
library whether it was by Gara or whether it has been attributed to Gara I
don't know it starts says vishwamitra asked vagara the following questions
there are 100 questions first ad 100 questions he asked about how this whole
universe started what are these planets what is the distance from Sun to Earth
what is the distance from Sun to the other planets questions like that and
what are these comets how did they happen and he talks about how did the
rivers come up how did the mountains come up these are the kinds of questions which are there and what is rutu what is
parva what are nakshatras I mean as a teacher I always encourage my students
to ask questions if in my class in I they did not ask a question say you
people are not good you to ask question you should not take a teacher for granted you not just their head and go
away that is not the right thing 100 questions and the answers are equally interesting in Mah that was the Zeal why
after the par Tantra and I started with Thea I would pause the initial chapters
but then come to mahasa First and finish Maham it is not a very detailed book in
the sense it has only about equivalent of 300 shlokas about 300 400 verses not
longer than that even though it is in Pros approximately I'm telling but the content is enormous and it says this
star became nakshatra it explains the legend of rohini and S now in the
puranas it is called The Legend of rohini and Chandra and Chandra becomes
Raj yakma that is becoming he decreases in the dark Fortnight is what he said
the Krishna Paka but why in the Krishna pakaak increases is quite clear the
Krishna Paka he decreases Shaka s comes in s happens only in the Krishna Paka
for the dieties so the Vic Legend is not as in the Panic it says prapti stayed
only with rohini that is why the other 27 or 28 they got angry went to the
prapti and so prapti call S and the answer is given by Chandra and Chandra
says I move with all of your daughters I treat all of them equally that that is
not clear I in all of them like the he says so
that is what I doing but says no I will curse you with rajma but what is rajma
rajma is a to prevent that given in
the that is what it is there in theas the 17 and S understands he clearly says
what had in his Manas s understood or chra understood that means the single
rohini becomes anatra because in the v rohini is in
whereas later on Rini has five stars so rohini was very important during the Dua
period when Dua was fixed rohini was the star in the wasant
so the year was perhaps taken up because
Sam Sam itself is as per The Vedas and that was with the I given the quotations
and all that in the Kaka it comes and the prapti Rupa is
when rohini rises in this wasant that is the Mantra which is there and that had changed due to precision and hence the
rohini the single star which was in a had to become multiple star with five
stars now which is a companion
of the number of stars for rohini is only one whereas the number of stars for
cria is six whereas in all other text the number of stars for rohini is five even in the
Buddhist shardul and also in the G Su
prra chra they also give m multiple Stars so the number of stars as per
parasara and V are going to be totally 86 so the S understanding
that so it becomes only one multiple stars become a single nakshatra and
there are 27 and they move equally in all of them that is the understanding that an astronomical statement
absolutely there's so much information here so stepping back again if you can recap a little bit so what you have said
is look we have the Vic time period and then of course we come to uh that is up
to the upanishad upanishad time then so the observations of one kind then we see
the Mah Salam observations which kind of fall later and then afterwards we see the Vaga parar and Raga is that a
correct way of thinking yeah could be this word Vaga has to be with strokes
and dash and one two kind of things so we don't know exactly um even parasar may be multiple
that's also possible because there are gotra names you know you can't say exactly who was that but the development
of the subject has been like that that is true so that that so that fills the huge gap before the santic astronomy
correct so contrary to General should we say the thought thought that we we now
have a clean flow of acreative in information uh knowledge being increased
from the Vic period onto the santic period of and yeah up to that in other
words the santic people had something already whether they used it or not is a
different matter and that that is also in the puranas the important thing is
puranas in that also in the Mah liit comes because how do we fix up the date
of Madam asraam which nakra is that this has been the major question for the
historians and indologist because in MAA there are six stars so if the take the
Precision to move for sun to move that it will take 900 years or thousand years
so why do you say it is a third second Millenium BC it may be 500 BC this has
been the argument which has been put up and that can be sorted only by looking
in the Braha puran brahmanda purana gives the
equinoxes what we call today Equinox The Equinox full moon position it gives so
the full moon position in the Equinox that means you know full moon can occur any month at any time but the Equinox if
it occurs it gives some message because exactly on the opposite side sun will be
there if it is a full moon yes so I know the longitude of the full the Sun and I
can apply a Precision principle with reference to the full moon and come to a conclusion and fortunately that is
available and that can be shown that the brahmas those four verses they belong to
the magadi period that is same as the M ARA when the sumers Sal St was in MAA
beginning same as in mahasa when Maga and moon they were measured the AA was
from the Maga nakshatra same thing also in the brahmanda puran this we have
published but that is actually a computer simulation work because we located for 2,000 years like we did in
the other case also you know find the minimum error position here also we have followed the same thing because Maga
will have Stars thousand year variation comes we have Kika and vishaka they are
almost close single Stars vishaka has only two they are binaries they're
together whether you take Libra one or Libra 2 you get the same answer okay in cria also whether you take t or
something else you get the same answer it won't change much and they're subjected to Precision which should also
intersect the statements which are given in mAh and also in
the that intersection gives two answers the lower bound is 18800 BC the upper
bound is 1600 BC so in this 200 years or about 300 years this condition was
possible for all the three text put together amazing amazing okay so there
is not a single year I can get but it is a era I get that is the Madi
so Maham as I said also knows the of moon ion of moon is the key for observational
astronomy this not just Theon of sun which has come from the Vic perod
is and all this explains theas says
there are 108
Gras clear gives there are 101
comets the p is used even in santic astronomy for planets and sun and moon
they make totally 1008 oh amazing so that is the number that is why we have
thisam right I should share some more information if there is time yeah goad
okay as I said the Mah is getting published by the central Sanskrit
University so the text is in Sanskrit but my introduction explanation
translation they're mostly in English even though Sanskrit quotations and those things are all given it contains
two chapters of introduction the first chapter is about manuscript collection
what I told you what is there in the first chapter second chapter and why this is important how do we fix up the
dates because this collection of books imagine there is a big book yes it has
what we call the footprints on the sands of time corre there is one in 1300 BC
there is one in 500 BC so whatever mahasa whether I fix up the date or not
initially I did not know about the DAT how to do that should be older so this I
had to do that so that mahum can be shown to be older because the language is older later on I came across
this brahmand Pana can be combined with this you know that is how we did that Madi thing now the book apart from the
two chapters of introduction one is on the manuscript the second is on why it is vanga where all it explains the vas
where something in the v is not understood like now there is so much of controversy
about the word TI and if you see Nag's history of ancient astronomy yeah he
says about BL cannot be understood without the concept of Titi but it
doesn't say that it could have come from India it is a Sanskrit word now ping
totally ignes and he coins a new word the plural of the should be called t t t
h s induran or instead of the no what
whatever it is and that is all very wrong because the word paati is coin for
the first time as an instantaneous Tang later on later astrologers and
astronomers have used the same word like it happens today also we do such things
but in the ancient text there is nothing like a it is PR is the first day yes and then
the you don't attach anything with that and that goes to the Vic usage that will take too much time because I I can't
cover it now because it goes to the brah how did they do that the months how did
they handle because they knew that the cic period was less than 30 more than 29
yes that is paima to Pima is neither 29 nor 30 so through a legend they
establish there has to be 59 A Kar is going to be day and night it
is not half of the today it is half of the in the older time it was not like that g gives all of that in this text he
discusses that and he takes concept from the phases of the moon the phases of the
moon he says in this book five colors are drunk on the
PCH remaining five colors
are the remaining five colors are taken so he gives a nonlinear variation given
the graph and showed all of that so so so I mean step what you are saying is
the moon as it darkens right it does not happen in the same PA but there's a
difference so that is what is being referred to here correct correct initially there is a five day thing they
they say and then the remaining five days then the remaining five days the the thing is this initially if you
wanted to call them tities they knew the moon rise they would be observing I don't know by what name they called them
there would have been only five TI his gives nand badra there only F
tities as the Ancients and it recycles in the Paka he gives it even though by
theth Century ad this concept of TI had become so much of a problematic issue
and to find the distance between Sun and Moon as 12° because they had already come to
trigonometric things here it was the transition period observation getting
into geometry getting in the shba sutras to the right angle triangle and its
properties and measure and putting circles and all that so it is a transition so
trigonometric Concepts would have evolved during that period between 800
BC to 100 BC or somewhere you that period could be that for that we had to
do more work work and find out now coming back to mahasa Mah is the key for
this because it said the cidial period is 67 they were interested in the
position of moon with nakra why the was there they were doing the Dasa that is
You observe directly D is seen you do on that day you do this that's all over you
needed more intelligence to observe the ion of moon yeah and that was done for astrology
because the S became Moon actually s is not equivalent to moon and then also
associated with the mind that is in the not here are there only three
meanings there can be more is the Primal time that comes out in this text in the
Mah that comes out because of astrology what we call astrology today that is the
M see the Vic astrology was anomaly portance finding out portance anomalies
and then forecasting based on the anomalies whether there will be more rainfall whether there will be
destruction what will happen to your person kind of thing observing the stars
that so can we say in a sense so it was more more of a a meteorological thinking
rather than looking at an individual person's future is that is that a reasonable way to think no in the
mahasan the materical thinking is there which which has come from the Vic text
yes and that meteorology is not just the what you call the atmospheric phenomenon
they're interested in the sky phenomen the celestial phenomen so it is the celestial study if you can call it that
is what they call it meterological is going to be rainfall and all of these things that they knew
that is an anomal is there no doubt on that but this is more serious than that
I understand okay got it and in that he says inra when moon is with the nakra you can
do all things connected with ay with fire that means you can do a h you can
do some vessels making you can do smiy work if you want you can also eat
something which is very FY things like that all those things which are combined
can be done and for Kanas for
women can be done on Katra is what he said why because prajapati that is s
combined with kikas as fire in the most ancient time that is that is a very
interesting information that is AG and mahasa says
s is always masculine whereas nakshatras
are all feminine and he gives an example in practice is used
ining but in effect p is also only and
the combination of this AG whole universe
is it's a combination of and and all these are various formations
of that you recollect
your it is same as this is the plus and minus principle yes and he says that
when the two combine when for common people what corresponding Karma should
be done because all activities of the prajapati yes the initial thing happened
simply because these two combined Ag and S combined not that Andra combined
during creation no the creation is very clearly said it
is is the dark matter which was there salum in that Sala there is a sudden
explosion like an egg and that egg split into two the top part became the
wal the bottom part was like a shell or whatever you may call it it expanded
that is the pr because it widened it became in between
what you see whatever you see in between this an
and All Creations will die also in the
Ana it also dies in The anara that is the first statement of V for creation
then he comes to the other things which is like R
10.72 is that the creat yeah it is it is the yeah it is no that is the other one
that is the it is not the you have to be careful Pur Creations
a little bit is given in mahasa but it has a different kind of lineage maybe in
those days they thought differently there different schools thinking differently yes like today know we argue
and say no no it cannot be like there also that been and one tradition has
come to us what are the others we don't know and he also talks of comets as I
said and the meu centonomy and there Dua is he says Dua was already established
before by prajapati at the tip of meu above all other deas and all these go
around sun and moon also goes around meu and when sun goes behind meu there is
going to be ratri that is the definition is given and he
clearly says there are four divisions for the Earth morning midnight evening
morning midm morning then evening and midnight so the whole of prvi is divided
into four parts quadrants four quadrants so wherever sun rises that is the East
for that wherever sun sets that is the East West for that but when sun is
rising for the makes sense okay so now we have the it will be yes it will be noon in the
Jambu and it is going to be evening in the ketum malaa and it is night in the
utu this is the same concept which has been taken into the Gad and into the cosmology in the santic
astronomy also so we can really see this progression of uh knowledge exactly
exactly very keen observation jotting them down coming up with the ideas of
what it is it is the correct it is the history of ideas know that is more
important and then as it happens in science you check the hypothesis it
doesn't work you change it now the pan has given SAS so new things have come up yes and
he also says why there is going to be summer the days are longer in near
summer in summer where days are shorter he says the sun is very near theu very
near PR so it has to be it going to be more hot some reasons are given like
that yes this has been developed in the puranas the Panic astronomy has not been
studied clearly and what is the connection between all this has not been studied yeah now coming back to mahasa
apart from my work there are two excellent four words one is in Sanskrit
that is by Professor Vian pandurangi who is the head of the the dean of the
vedanta studies Kat K and he has written
a vakana also for Reda he's writing a vak he's a Vic scholar also I don't know
whether you know him personally or know extraordinary person indeed so I have
discussed these things with him how this should be interpreted what is the interpretation he we discussed with
him so much and he has read through all of this and he clearly says many of the
things like he says the take it one yes so should not be taken seriously
their view they go along a different line he also says thean they do something else
go into other issues whereas the aravada has been ignored as meaningless
and many of the westerners they making their own writings on these things and
he clearly calls for a new way of looking at the Vic things because this
mahasa gives some Clues to what is real Vang see for example using n you can
understand V using grammar you can understand V using the sutras you
understand V that's like theik all that how do you understand the sky is no good
not for this now parasar and help but are they real Vang Tex they are but they
may be towards the end of the perod where Mah hardore
like say it is this is also there right sitting there yes and the second forward is in
English whom you know Professor MD Shas yes he has written an
extraordinary bird's eye view of pre santic astronomy as you know he
wonderful yes in astronomy he has written a very extensive forward and why
and how Mah Salam becomes important for History of Science not just for the
Sanskrit Scholars they would be should be interested for the Vic studies and for history of this country yes I'm
sitting in America talking History of Science yeah history of sence everywhere
but forat now there is so much of talk that is happening that we to retrieve the
history before know what happened you go up to Sandra Gupta Ma and then look up
and down don't know what to do then you go to Buddhist now all the buddhistic
history has been appropriated I would say by others who
are very nice people by Scholars but they are not insiders yes who don't know
the cultural implications of this now the Sanaya implication itself
is not known the all the lexans only give hav it is a kind of a hav look into
Mon Williams you look into you look into anybody even op even SHP and that yes I
don't blame them whatever was there contemporarily they have collected and yeah theum approach is actually has
helped protect the information right now we can take the you see everything protects the
information but if you want progress you want understand question unless you
question you will not get an and it is questioning in fact I was when I started
this streamyard there was a short clip there's a conversation between ramanan
and another Pandit this in Sanskrit it talks about buddhi and how buddhi develops when you keep on doing the same
thing again and again and again that itself questions a new thing comes up
but it is not just the repetition it should be some opening should be there contemplation more like contemplation
there has to be some space see man that Manana has to be there you can
call it contl or whatever if that Manana is there something will come out well
anyway that is another matter which ask Professor when is the when is mahal
Salam going to be published did you say is it well I think we have to check with
the CSU people I'm sure they will bring it as quickly as possible in the coming
few few months I would say is that few months at least few months it will take you know okay so this yeah this work is
going to fill the Gap like you said from the Vic period then we have the information then we have the Raga
information then we have the parasar information then later again aspects
from gagara then we come to Arya and bar
so this whole huge say three and a half thousand 4,000 year information we have
absolute we have some idea of what was happening there are still many gaps yes
discontinuities and all that that is one I I would like to mention how the
concept that Earth was flat change to Earth is a globe that's an extremely
important question yeah extremely important question that is one second
Venus what is the position of Venus shukra in The Vedas there is a word
brhaspati also in the vasp and shukar are always against you came to the issue yes that
is in the puranas the pur maintains some of the Vic Legends in a mared way like
the S Chandra rohini Legend as I told you in a mared manner that we have to
untangle that we have to read the puranas also compare the puran the panas
are too large the text and we have to make meaning out of them and instead of telling only there are this V this V I
have to B this okay I also do Raa but we do important but do something beyond
that intellectual thing has to be done yes it is the and AP viya All That
classification I also agree and all that but once you say this is the viya which
is thear I have to do it in way only intellectualis that is available but
somebody has to look into that in large numbers and dispassionately analyze I'm
happy CSU has accepted to publish it because I was wondering who will how I
can find a publisher for this I mean I think this in some sense as people um who will watch this we welcome you to
come and join and ask questions and meet with Professor AAR discuss this uh and
hopefully we'll find more people to join along with this research work thank you I agree with you on that okay sir I
think we are coming to the end of this recording so I I will just recap again just so that uh people who will watch
this we started off from the Vic period we have given information about Maham
and the amazing information that's there then we have again the later on information about parant Anda aspects so
this gives a very smooth transition of course there's a lot more details to be filled in and uh we see this pre prear
astronomical observations so it helps us build out a much deeper and richer History of Science in India and that's
specifically astronomical observations and uh anyway Professor thank you very much for giving us the time and then I
would also ask all the viewers to please subscribe to aara Forum it's one of those rare channels here which gives you
this level of details uh so please subscribe please support uh this tho
Forum the people behind it are extremely hardworking they give a lot of time as well so huge thanks to so Professor
again thank you for your wonderful time and I hope um it will motivate more
people to take up the history of science uh in India and uh Namaste thank you again thank you very much thank to share
My Views and work with the aura Forum thank you Namaste yeah I mean I must say
that the work you have done is going to change whole perception of knowledge tradition in India it's it's an
unbelievable work that you have done you and your students sir again thank you and thanks all please subscribe to AA
